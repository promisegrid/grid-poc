# grid-poc

Experimental proof of concept with these tentative goals:

- Maybe POC that just takes data on input and spits out CBOR or vice versa
- Maybe POC that takes CBOR in, finds and executes method in k/v transition function map, spits out CBOR
- Maybe POC that takes an event, generates CBOR hyperedge, emits an event
- Maybe POC that takes an event, stores CBOR hyperedge, emits an event
