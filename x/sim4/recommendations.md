### Recommendations for PromiseGrid System Refinement

**Establish Bidirectional Hypergraph Chaining**  
Modify node creation logic to enforce storage of the generating hyperedge's CID within each node. The design must require nodes to explicitly reference their creator hyperedges through cryptographic hashes, enabling backward traversal verification[4][5][10]. Implement merklepath resolution similar to IPFS[4][19] where nodes contain both predecessor node hashes and the hyperedge CID that produced them. This satisfies the "each node must include the hash of the edge that created it" requirement while maintaining content addressing integrity[5][19]. Optimize storage using incremental hashing to avoid redundant data replication.
