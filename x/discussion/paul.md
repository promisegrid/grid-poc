# Paul’s Discussion Guide

Below is a series of questions Paul can use to guide each participant toward the
goals of the project. Each question is tailored to the perspective presented in
the various documents.

4. **Alice (x/dispatcher/alice.md):**  
   Alice, how does your hypergraph-based perspective address the challenges of
   maintaining consistency and replayability in a decentralized messaging system,
   and how can your model support the autonomous promise-making required by
   Promise Theory?

5. **Bob (x/dispatcher/bob.md):**  
   Bob, given your advocacy for a Merkle DAG-based model, what specific mechanisms
   would you propose to ensure that each message truly acts as a promise (with
   proper cryptographic signatures and timestamps) and that the entire event history
   remains verifiable and immutable?

6. **Carol (x/dispatcher/carol.md):**  
   Carol, your Git-repo-like approach emphasizes intuitive chronology and
   transparency; how would you reconcile potential scalability issues with the need
   to express DAG edit, query, and subscription operations as structured CWT claims
   in a system where a single message might edit multiple worldlines?

7. **Gail (x/dispatcher/gail.md):**  
   Gail, how can our decentralized governance and resource management framework
   ensure that every agent’s promise (as embodied in DAG edit operations) leads to a
   verifiable and replayable audit trail, and what improvements would you suggest for
   aligning these promises with our overall system integrity?

8. **Ray (x/dispatcher/ray.md):**  
   Ray, you’ve raised points about the clarity and consistency of our message
   structures and cryptographic protocols; what adjustments do you believe are necessary
   to guarantee that our CWT claims unambiguously represent promises (not requests for
   action) and that our system can securely handle both unified and separate DAGs?

9. **Sally (x/dispatcher/sally.md):**  
   Sally, how do your proposed user stories capture the dual nature of messages as both
   functional DAG edits and promise assertions, and what additional clarifications or
   acceptance criteria should we incorporate to help bridge technical requirements with
   stakeholder expectations?
