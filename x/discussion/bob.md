# Position Paper: Bob's Perspective on the Merkle DAG Worldline Model

## Introduction

I propose that the structure of all worldlines in our messaging system be
defined as a Merkle Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This model leverages the
benefits of cryptographic integrity and efficient event verification.

## The Merkle DAG Worldline Model

In our model, each event is recorded as a leaf node within a Merkle DAG.
Internal nodes are produced by hashing child nodes, compressing history
into verifiable summaries. This not only secures an audit trail but
also fosters trust through cryptographic proofs.

### Key Characteristics

- **Cryptographic Hashing:**  
  Each internal nodeâ€™s hash is derived from its children. Any tampering
  becomes instantly detectable due to changes in the hash chain.

- **Immutability of Events:**  
  Once recorded, events become immutable parts of the DAG, critical for
  security audits and debugging.

- **Efficient Verification:**  
  The structure allows rapid integrity checks, even as log sizes grow.

## Advantages Over Alternative Models

- **Trust and Security:**  
  Embedding cryptographic proofs guarantees tamper detection, which is
  essential in distrustful distributed environments.

- **Modularity and Scalability:**  
  The separation of leaves and internal nodes supports scalable growth in
  verification as the event log expands.

- **Deterministic Event Ordering:**  
  Unique event hashes ensure clear, verifiable sequences, aiding tracking
  and replay operations.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Storage Overhead:**  
  Increased storage for events and intermediate nodes calls for careful
  optimization strategies.

- **Reactive Verification:**  
  Real-time hash chain checking must be supported across our
  decentralized, dynamic environment.

## Conclusion

Implementing a Merkle DAG provides a resilient and verifiable framework.
It secures event history with cryptographic methods and supports robust
traceability, placing us in strong stead for future system evolution.

## Next Steps

To move the discussion forward, I recommend:
- **Integration Testing:**  
  Set up testbeds that simulate high event volumes to benchmark
  verification efficiency.
- **Interdisciplinary Workshops:**  
  Collaborate across domains to refine DAG management algorithms and
  discover storage optimizations.
