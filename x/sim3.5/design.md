# PromiseGrid System Architecture Design

PromiseGrid presents a novel distributed computing framework centered around security capability tokens that function as promises for future computation. This revised design addresses identified discrepancies while preserving the system's core innovations in capability-based security, hypergraph transactions, and speculative execution workflows.

## Enhanced Security Capability Token Implementation

### Standard-Compliant Token Encoding
Tokens now implement **RFC 8392 CBOR Web Token (CWT) standards** with explicit claim structure:
```
{
  "iss": "agent_identifier",  // Token issuer ID
  "iat": 1689984000,          // Issuance timestamp
  "prm": {                    // Promise claims
    "action": "compute:fft",
    "deadline": 1692576000,
    "resource": "GPU-8GB"
  },
  "rep": "reply_port_hash"    // Result return destination
}
```
All tokens require **EdDSA signatures** using issuer private keys, enabling cryptographic proof of liability. Token headers include **capability delegation chains** documenting transfer history through nested COSE_Key structures per RFC 8152[3][7][15]. This creates unforgeable audit trails while maintaining CWT interoperability.

### Kernel-Level Liability Enforcement
The kernel now implements **liability discharge triggers** where:
1. Unredeemed tokens after deadline convert to claim tokens
2. Claim tokens permit partial stake seizure
3. Repeated defaults decay issuer reputation scores
**Cross-kernel revocation tickets** enable port cleanup by:
- Issuing time-bound (TTL: 24h) capability certificates
- Propagating revocation notices through gossip protocol
- Automatically reclaiming ports from unresponsive agents[3][14]

## Hypergraph Structure with Cryptographic Bindings

### Bidirectional Content Addressing
The hypergraph now enforces **tamper-evident linkage** through dual hashing:
1. Each hyperedge includes SHA3-256 hashes of all tail nodes
2. Each new node contains the hash of its generating hyperedge
3. Genesis nodes use deterministic initialization vectors
This creates a **Merkle proof chain** where state derivation requires:
1. Start from known genesis hash
2. Follow hyperedge-node-hyperedgedge sequences
3. Validate hashes at each transition[5][8][10]

### Speculative Execution Framework
**Stake-weighted branch resolution** prevents hypergraph bloat:
1. Agents propose branches with computation-stake bonds
2. Conflicting branches trigger BFT voting among bondholders
3. Winning branch absorbs 90% of losing bonds
4. Remaining 10% distributes to voters
**Branch decay dynamics** automatically prune paths using:
```math
W_b = e^{-\lambda t} \times \frac{S_b}{S_{total}}
```
Where:
- Î» = Configurable decay rate (default: 0.01/sec)
- S = Staked computation resources
- t = Time since creation[6][9][12]

## Token-Based Economic Model Enhancements

### Market-Driven Valuation Mechanics
Token exchange rates emerge through **reputation-weighted pricing**:
```math
V_{token} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} (F_i \times R_i) }{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} D_i }
```
Where:
- F = Successful fulfillments (last 30 days)
- R = Reputation score (0.0 - 1.0)
- D = Defaults/deadline misses
This combines historical performance with market activity to establish fair value[7][9][16].

### Computation Insurance Pools
**Risk mutualization mechanisms** protect token holders:
1. Issuers deposit collateral proportional to promise risk
2. Valid claims draw from pooled funds
3. Premiums adjust dynamically based on:
   - Historical fulfillment rate
   - Computational complexity
   - Deadline urgency
Pool governance uses **reputation-quadratic voting** to prevent manipulation[1][5][16].

## State Representation and Token Redemption

### Pure Function Execution Model
All computations implement **side-effect-free semantics**:
1. Redemption requests include input data blobs
2. Executors process inputs in sandboxed environments
3. Results sign with executor keys
4. Original issuer remains liable for validation
This enables **verifiable computation reuse** through deterministic replay.

### Enhanced Redemption Workflow
The revised redemption protocol:
1. Holder creates hyperedge containing:
   - Redeemed token (signed)
   - Input data CID
   - New reply token
2. Kernel routes to issuer's receive port
3. Issuer either:
   a) Executes computation, returns result via reply token, OR
   b) Delegates to executor with liability chain
4. Failure triggers:
   - Automatic claim token generation
   - Reputation decay
   - Stake seizure after dispute period[3][5]

## Implementation Roadmap

### Priority Features
1. **COSE token encoding** - Q1 2025
2. **Bidirectional hashing enforcement** - Q1 2025
3. **Reputation oracle service** - Q2 2025
4. **Automated claim adjudication** - Q3 2025

### Optimization Targets
1. Branch decay simulation tuning
2. Delegation depth impact analysis
3. Insurance pool risk modeling
4. Cross-kernel latency benchmarks

## Open Research Questions
1. What **formal methods** verify state consistency across divergent paths?
2. How do **delegation chains** impact liability attribution depth?
3. Can **zero-knowledge proofs** validate computations without disclosure?
4. What **graph pruning heuristics** optimize storage without sacrificing auditability?
5. How should **temporal consensus bounds** handle relativistic effects in global deployment?

This refined architecture establishes PromiseGrid as a verifiable, incentive-aligned framework for decentralized computation. By reconciling cryptographic accountability with economic security, the system enables trustworthy speculative execution at internet scale.
