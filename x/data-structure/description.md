# Recommended Data Structures for Grid POC

## Overview

To efficiently store and retrieve a vast number of large byte sequences and to search for small subsequences within them, we recommend utilizing a combination of deterministic and probabilistic data structures, supplemented by Monte Carlo methods. This document explores several approaches suitable for the given problem, including those previously considered, as well as new suggestions involving Monte Carlo and probabilistic data structures.

## Problem Statement

- **Storage Requirements**:
  - **Large Sequences**: Ranging from a few bytes to hundreds of gigabytes.
  - **Number of Sequences**: From a few to billions.
  - **Dynamic Updates**: Frequent appends and slight modifications to large sequences while preserving the original versions (forming a graph structure of versions).
- **Search Requirements**:
  - **Subsequence Size**: From a few bytes to hundreds of megabytes.
  - **Goal**: Efficiently find small subsequences among all large sequences.

## Recommended Approaches

### 1. Content-Addressable Storage with Merkle Trees/DAGs

#### Description

- **Merkle Trees/DAGs**:

- **Application**:
  - Break large sequences into smaller chunks.
  - Store chunks as nodes in a Merkle tree or DAG.
  - Facilitate efficient storage, retrieval, and versioning.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Deduplication**: Identical chunks across different sequences are stored once.
  - **Integrity Verification**: Easy to verify data integrity using hashes.
  - **Version Control**: Supports tracking changes and branching, suitable for handling modifications and appends.

### 2. Radix Trees (Patricia Tries)

#### Description

- **Radix Trees**:
  - Compressed prefix trees that store common prefixes of keys only once.
- **Application**:
  - Store sequences and subsequences efficiently by exploiting shared prefixes.
  - Facilitate quick lookups and insertions.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Space Efficiency**: Reduced memory usage due to prefix compression.
  - **Fast Operations**: Quick search, insert, and delete operations.
- **Considerations**:
  - Well-suited for variable-length keys.
  - May need adaptation for handling large sequences and subsequences.

### 3. Suffix Trees and Suffix Arrays

#### Suffix Trees

- **Description**:
  - Tree structures representing all suffixes of a sequence.
- **Application**:
  - Allow for fast pattern matching and substring searching.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Efficiency**: Linear time complexity for many operations.
- **Limitations**:
  - **Memory Intensive**: High space requirements, especially with large datasets.

#### Suffix Arrays with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) and FM-Index

- **Suffix Arrays**:
  - Arrays storing the starting indices of all suffixes of a sequence in lexicographical order.
- **Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)**:
  - Transforms the sequence to make it more compressible.
  - Facilitates efficient searching when combined with FM-index.
- **FM-Index**:
  - A compressed full-text index derived from BWT.
- **Application**:
  - Efficient exact substring searches within large sequences.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Space Efficiency**: More compact than suffix trees.
  - **Scalability**: Suitable for large datasets.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Widely used in bioinformatics (e.g., genome sequencing).

### 4. Probabilistic Data Structures

#### Bloom Filters

- **Description**:
  - Probabilistic data structure for set membership queries.
- **Application**:
  - Quickly check if a subsequence possibly exists in the dataset.
  - Filter out sequences that definitely do not contain the subsequence.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Space Efficiency**: Requires minimal memory.
  - **Speed**: Very fast query times.
- **Limitations**:
  - **False Positives**: Can indicate an element is present when it is not.
  - **No Position Information**: Cannot retrieve where the subsequence occurs.

#### Counting Bloom Filters

- **Description**:
  - Extension of Bloom filters that allows for element deletion.
- **Application**:
  - Handle dynamic updates (appends and deletions) in the dataset.
- **Benefits**:
  - Maintains counts of elements for more accurate tracking.

#### Count-Min Sketch

- **Description**:
  - Probabilistic data structure for frequency estimation.
- **Application**:
  - Estimate the frequency of subsequences in real-time data streams.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Space Efficiency**: Requires less space than exact methods.
  - **Speed**: Quick update and query times.
- **Limitations**:
  - **Approximate Results**: May overestimate frequencies.

#### Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)

- **Description**:
  - Hashing scheme that maps similar items to the same hash buckets.
- **Application**:
  - Find similar subsequences by hashing and comparing hash buckets.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Efficiency**: Enables approximate nearest neighbor searches in high-dimensional data.
- **Limitations**:
  - **Parameter Sensitivity**: Requires careful tuning of hash functions.
  - **Approximation**: May miss some matches due to probabilistic nature.

### 5. Monte Carlo Methods

#### Description

Monte Carlo methods employ randomness to obtain numerical results for problems that might be deterministic. They provide solutions with probabilistic guarantees based on statistical sampling.

#### Application in Subsequence Search

- **Random Sampling**:
  - Randomly sample positions or sequences to estimate the presence of a subsequence.
- **Approximate Pattern Matching**:
  - Use probabilistic algorithms to find matches with high confidence.
- **Frequency Estimation**:
  - Estimate how often a subsequence occurs by sampling a subset of data.

#### Benefits

- **Scalability**: Handles very large datasets by considering only a subset.
- **Flexibility**: Accuracy can be improved by increasing sample size.
- **Performance**: Reduced computational requirements compared to exhaustive search.

#### Considerations

- **Accuracy vs. Performance**: Trade-off between the number of samples and the confidence level of results.
- **Use Cases**: Suitable when exact matches are less critical, or as a preliminary step before exact methods.

### 6. Hybrid Approaches

#### Combining Deterministic and Probabilistic Methods

- **Two-Phase Search**:
  - **Phase 1**: Use probabilistic data structures (e.g., Bloom Filters) or Monte Carlo methods to identify candidate sequences quickly.
  - **Phase 2**: Apply deterministic methods (e.g., Suffix Arrays) on candidates for exact matching.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Efficiency**: Reduces the search space and computational load.
  - **Accuracy**: Ensures precise results where needed.

#### Dynamic Data Handling

- **Version Control with Merkle DAGs**:

  - Efficiently handle modifications and appends while preserving history.
- **Chunk-Based Deduplication**:
  - Break sequences into chunks (e.g., using content-defined chunking).
  - Deduplicate chunks across versions to save space.

#### Implementation Strategies

- **Parallel Processing**:
  - Leverage parallelism for indexing and searching.
- **Distributed Systems**:
  - Use distributed storage and computation to handle large-scale data.

## Additional Considerations

### Frequent Appends and Modifications

- **Immutable Data Structures**:
  - Use immutable data blocks to simplify concurrency and versioning.
- **Functional Programming Concepts**:
  - Apply concepts from functional programming to manage state changes efficiently.

### Graph Structure of Versions

- **Persistent Data Structures**:
  - Structures that preserve previous versions of themselves when modified.
- **Application**:
  - Model the evolution of sequences over time.
  - Enable efficient branching and merging operations.

### Scalability and Performance

- **Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs)**:
  - Distribute the storage of sequences across multiple nodes.
- **Caching Strategies**:
  - Implement caching to improve access times for frequently requested data.
- **Load Balancing**:
  - Distribute workload evenly to prevent bottlenecks.

### Security and Collision Handling

- **Cryptographic Hash Functions**:
  - Use strong hash functions to minimize the probability of collisions.
- **Namespace Partitioning**:
  - Combine hashes with additional identifiers (e.g., sequence IDs, paths) to ensure uniqueness.

## Conclusion

For the Grid POC, a combination of deterministic and probabilistic data structures, along with Monte Carlo methods, is recommended to meet the requirements of efficient storage, retrieval, and subsequence searching in vast datasets.
