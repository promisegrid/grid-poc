# Recommended Data Structures for Grid POC

## Problem Statement

The Grid POC aims to efficiently store and retrieve a vast number of large byte sequences and find small subsequences within them. The key requirements are:

- **Large Sequence Storage**:
  - Sizes range from a few bytes to hundreds of gigabytes.
  - Number of sequences ranges from a few to billions.
- **Subsequence Search**:
  - Subsequence sizes range from a few bytes to hundreds of megabytes.
  - Need to efficiently find small subsequences within large sequences.
- **Dynamic Updates and Versioning**:
  - Must handle frequent appends to large sequences.
  - Must handle slight modifications while preserving original sequences (forming a graph structure of versions).

## Recommended Data Structures

Based on the requirements, the following data structures and algorithms are recommended:

### 1. Content-Addressable Storage with Merkle DAGs

#### Description

**Content-Addressable Storage with Merkle Directed Acyclic Graphs (Merkle DAGs)** provides a robust method for storing and retrieving large data sequences in a way that ensures data integrity, deduplication, and efficient versioning.

- **Chunking**:

  - **Purpose of Chunking**:
    - Dividing large sequences into smaller, manageable pieces facilitates storage, transmission, deduplication, and parallel processing.
  - **Chunk Size**:
    - Chunks can vary in size (e.g., 4 KB to 4 MB), and the optimal size depends on factors such as system capabilities and expected data patterns.
    - Employing content-defined chunking techniques (e.g., Rabin fingerprinting) allows the system to detect boundaries based on the content, which enhances deduplication and consistency across similar data.
  - **Chunk Identification**:
    - Each chunk is assigned a unique identifier derived from a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256, BLAKE2).
    - The cryptographic hash ensures that any change in the chunk's content results in a different hash, enabling integrity verification and deduplication.

- **Merkle Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**:

  - **Structure**:
    - The Merkle DAG is a hierarchical data structure where nodes represent data chunks or collections of chunks, and edges represent the inclusion of one node within another.
    - Leaf nodes correspond to the actual data chunks, while internal nodes represent a collection (e.g., concatenation) of their child nodes.
  - **Hash Calculation**:
    - Each non-leaf node's hash is computed from the hashes of its child nodes and, optionally, any associated metadata.
    - The root node's hash (root hash) represents the entire data sequence and serves as a unique identifier for the sequence.
  - **Data Representation**:
    - The DAG captures the composition of large data sequences from smaller chunks, allowing the system to reconstruct the original data by traversing from the root node to the leaf nodes.
  - **Example Illustration**:
    - Consider a large sequence split into four chunks: A, B, C, and D.
    - **Leaf Nodes**:
      - Nodes for chunks A, B, C, and D, each containing the data and its hash.
    - **Internal Nodes**:
      - Combine A and B into node AB, `hash(AB) = hash(hash(A) + hash(B))`.
      - Combine C and D into node CD, `hash(CD) = hash(hash(C) + hash(D))`.
    - **Root Node**:
      - Combine AB and CD into the root node ABCD, `hash(ABCD) = hash(hash(AB) + hash(CD))`.
    - The root hash `hash(ABCD)` uniquely identifies the entire sequence composed of chunks A, B, C, D.

- **Data Retrieval and Integrity Verification**:

  - To retrieve a sequence, the system uses the root hash to traverse the DAG, fetching and assembling the required chunks.
  - The integrity of the data can be verified at each step by recomputing hashes and comparing them with the stored node hashes.

**Usage in the Context of Grid POC**:

- **Efficient Storage**:

  - By breaking down large data sequences into chunks and organizing them in a Merkle DAG, the system can efficiently store and manage vast amounts of data.
  - The content-addressable nature of Merkle DAGs ensures that identical chunks are stored only once, optimizing storage space.

- **Deduplication**:

  - Chunks that are identical across different sequences or versions are automatically deduplicated due to their identical hashes.
  - This significantly reduces storage redundancy, especially when sequences share common data.

- **Version Control**:

  - Modifications to sequences result in new DAGs that share unchanged chunks with previous versions.
  - This mechanism naturally supports versioning and branching, similar to version control systems (e.g., Git).
  - The history of changes is maintained within the DAG structure, allowing for efficient tracking of sequence evolution.

- **Support for Variable-Length and Arbitrary Byte Sequences**:

  - Merkle DAGs can handle sequences of any length and content, including sequences containing any byte value or arbitrary sequences of bytes.
  - The system is capable of storing and retrieving variable-length byte sequences without constraints on the data format.

- **Concurrent Access and Immutability**:

  - Since the chunks and DAG structure are immutable (once created, they are not altered), multiple users or processes can access and read from the DAG concurrently without conflicts.
  - Immutability simplifies synchronization in distributed environments and reduces the risk of data corruption.

- **Graph Structure of Versions**:

  - The collection of DAGs representing different versions of sequences forms a larger DAG or a Merkle Forest.
  - This structure captures the relationships between versions and operations performed over time, forming a comprehensive version graph.

- **Efficient Data Transmission**:

  - When transmitting data between nodes, only the chunks not already present at the destination need to be sent.
  - The use of hashes facilitates quick identification of missing chunks, optimizing network bandwidth usage.

#### Benefits

- **Efficient Storage of Large Sequences**:

  - Large sequences are represented by their root hashes and DAG structures, allowing for compact storage representation.
  - Shared chunks between sequences are stored only once, greatly reducing storage requirements.

- **Deduplication**:

  - Identical chunks across sequences are automatically deduplicated due to identical hashes.
  - This is particularly beneficial when storing multiple versions or similar sequences.

- **Efficient Versioning and Modifications**:

  - Modifications or appends result in new nodes, but unchanged parts of the DAG are reused.
  - Allows for efficient storage of versions, forming a graph structure of sequence versions.
  - Facilitates quick access to any version without the need to duplicate entire sequences.

- **Integrity Verification**:

  - The integrity of sequences can be verified by recalculating and comparing the root hash.
  - Any alteration in the data is detectable due to changes in the corresponding hashes.

- **Scalability and Performance**:

  - The DAG structure scales efficiently with the size of the data.
  - Supports parallel retrieval and processing of chunks, enhancing performance.

- **Network Efficiency**:

  - Efficient synchronization and data distribution in distributed systems.
  - Only new or changed chunks need to be transferred, minimizing data transfer overhead.

#### Handling Dynamic Updates

- **Frequent Appends**:

  - Appending data involves creating new chunks for the added data and updating the DAG structure accordingly.
  - Only the affected nodes (from the point of change up to the root) need to be updated.

- **Preserving Original Sequences**:

  - Since the DAG is immutable, modifications create new paths without altering existing nodes.
  - Original sequences remain intact, ensuring data preservation and historical accuracy.

- **Graph of Versions**:

  - Versions of sequences form a DAG, providing a history of modifications and appends.
  - Allows tracing of changes over time and supports branching and merging operations.

- **Concurrent Modifications**:

  - Supports concurrent updates by different users or processes without conflict.
  - Merges can be performed by combining DAGs, leveraging shared chunks.

- **Garbage Collection**:

  - Unreferenced chunks (not part of any current DAG) can be identified and cleaned up.
  - Ensures efficient use of storage by removing obsolete data.

#### Considerations

- **Chunk Size Optimization**:

  - **Trade-offs**:
    - Smaller chunks may increase deduplication potential but result in higher overhead due to more metadata and increased network requests.
    - Larger chunks reduce metadata and network overhead but may decrease deduplication efficiency.
  - **Content-Defined Chunking**:
    - Techniques like Rabin fingerprinting allow chunk boundaries to be determined by content, improving deduplication for similar data with insertions or deletions.

- **Metadata Overhead**:

  - Managing the DAG structure requires additional metadata for nodes and their relationships.
  - Efficient metadata handling mechanisms are needed to mitigate performance impacts.

- **Latency and Performance**:

  - Fetching data may involve multiple network requests to retrieve all necessary chunks.
  - Caching strategies can be employed to reduce latency.

- **Security**:

  - Reliance on cryptographic hashes necessitates robust hash functions to prevent collisions and attacks.
  - Access control mechanisms may be required to protect sensitive data.

- **Data Availability**:

  - In distributed systems, ensuring all chunks are accessible when needed is crucial.
  - Replication strategies and redundancy are important for high availability.

- **Implementation Complexity**:

  - Building and maintaining a Merkle DAG infrastructure can be complex.
  - Requires careful design to handle variable-length data and high-volume sequences efficiently.
