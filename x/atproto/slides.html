# Bluesky, ATProto, IPFS, and PromiseGrid
## Steve Traugott

## CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs)

### Basic Concepts
- CWTs are compact tokens for representing claims, encoded using [CBOR](https://cbor.io).
- Can be secured using [CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8152).

---

## CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs)

### Structure and Flexibility
- Flexible claim structure allows representation of various data types.
- Can include standard claims (e.g., &#34;issuer&#34;, &#34;subject&#34;, &#34;expires&#34;) and custom claims.
- Supports nesting of CWTs for added security or combining claim sets.

### Use Cases
- Authentication and authorization in constrained environments (e.g., IoT).
- Potential use as capability tokens (explored by IETF ACE working group).
- Possible representation of promises in Promise Theory context.

## IPLD (InterPlanetary Linked Data)

### Relationship between IPFS and IPLD
- [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) (InterPlanetary File System) is a distributed file storage system that uses content-addressing to uniquely identify files.
- [IPLD](https://ipld.io) is the data model underlying IPFS; it defines a uniform way to link and reference data across different systems.
- In IPFS, data is stored as nodes in a [Merkle DAG](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/merkle-dag/) that adheres to the IPLD specification, enabling interoperability and verification of content.
- IPLD not only structures data within IPFS but also allows integration with other decentralized systems by providing a consistent addressing and linking mechanism.

### Use in atproto
- Atproto uses a variant of IPLD for its underlying data model.
- Custom JSON encoding used instead of standard [DAG-JSON](https://github.com/ipld/dag-json).
- [CBOR](https://cbor.io) is used for cryptographic operations in atproto.
- Incorporates a variant of [DAG-CBOR](https://github.com/ipld/dag-cbor) for certain operations.
- Leverages the principles of [ATProto](https://atproto.com) for protocol-specific implementations.

### Potential Integration with PromiseGrid

- PromiseGrid could leverage IPLD for storing and linking CWTs as promises.
- If so, will likely use dag-cbor.

---

## Promise Theory and CWTs

### Potential Representation
- CWTs could theoretically represent promises from Promise Theory.
- Flexible claim structure allows encoding of promise-related information.

### Considerations
- Promising agent should be represented as the issuer (iss) in CWT.
- The subject (sub) claim could represent the entity about which the promise is made.

## IETF ACE and CWTs for Capability Tokens

### Overview
- Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) working group.
- Exploring [CWTs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8392) for authorization in IoT scenarios.
- Flexible representation of capabilities and access rights.
- Secured using [COSE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8152) for integrity and optional encryption.
- If capability tokens are promises, and if CWTs are capability tokens, then CWTs could represent promises.
