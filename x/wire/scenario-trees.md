In complex systems literature, the term **"scenario tree"** is widely used to model systems with sequential decisions and probabilistic outcomes under uncertainty. This framework explicitly incorporates both *decisions* (controllable actions) and *outcomes* (uncontrollable events) across multiple stages.  

### Key Characteristics of Scenario Trees  
1. **Structural Components**:  
   - **Decision nodes**: Represent points where choices are made (e.g., investment levels, resource allocation).  
   - **Chance nodes**: Encode probabilistic outcomes (e.g., market fluctuations, demand variability).  
   - **End nodes**: Final states with associated payoffs or costs[3][4][8].  

2. **Temporal Evolution**:  
   - Branches represent sequences of decisions and stochastic events over time.  
   - Each path from root to leaf defines a unique scenario with cumulative probabilities[3][7].  

3. **Mathematical Representation**:  
   - Combines dynamic programming and stochastic processes to compute expected values via backward induction[5][7].  

### Applications in Complex Systems  
- **Financial Planning**: Optimizing portfolios under stochastic market conditions[3][7].  
- **Supply Chains**: Managing inventory with uncertain demand and pricing[3].  
- **Energy Systems**: Balancing generation strategies against fuel price volatility[3][7].  

### Does "Scenario Tree" Encompass Decisions and Outcomes?  
Yes. Scenario trees are designed to model **adaptive decision-making** in response to probabilistic outcomes:  
- **Decisions**: Represented at nodes where agents select actions (e.g., "expand production" vs. "abandon project")[4][8].  
- **Outcomes**: Quantified via probabilities at chance nodes (e.g., 30% chance of high demand)[3][5].  

For example, in a pharmaceutical R&D scenario tree[7]:  
1. **Decision**: Invest $50M in Phase 1 trials.  
2. **Outcome**: 70% success → proceed to Phase 2; 30% failure → terminate.  

This structure enables systems to balance sensitivity (responding to critical stimuli) and robustness (ignoring noise), a hallmark of complex adaptive systems[2][6].
