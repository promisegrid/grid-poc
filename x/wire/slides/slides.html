## What is a wire protocol?

A wire protocol is a set of rules that define:

- how data is formatted and transmitted over a network
- how to interpret the data once it is received
- how to handle errors and exceptions
- how to manage connections and sessions
- how to authenticate and authorize agents

### Why Wire Protocol Design Matters in Early Development

Early design decisions about the wire protocol can be difficult to
change once systems are in use.  This is because:

- A bad design can make it difficult to evolve the protocol
  without breaking existing installations.
- A bad design can lead early adopters to consider early versions of
  the protocol to be a defacto standard, making evolution difficult
  from a community perspective.

## PromiseGrid Vision: Decentralized Virtual Machine

PromiseGrid is implemented using a message-passing microkernel architecture:

- Message-passing: agents exchange structured messages
- Microkernel: minimal core, just enough to support message-passing
  agents
- &#34;There is no center&#34; -- no centralized authority or control.


More on this later.

## What is a kernel?

In computer science, a kernel is the core component of an operating
system that:

- manages system resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and I/O devices
- provides a communication interface between hardware and software
- provides a set of services for applications to interact with the
  hardware and network

---

## Conventional (Monolithic) Kernels

Windows and Linux use conventional (monolithic) kernels.  In these
systems, all of the kernel&#39;s functionality is implemented in a
monolithic piece of code that runs in &#34;ring 0&#34; of the CPU.  Ring 0
processes have full access and control over the hardware.

In current operating systems, including Linux, MacOS, and Windows,
applications run in &#34;user space&#34; (ring 3) and communicate with the
kernel using system calls such as &#39;open()&#39;, &#39;read()&#39;, and &#39;write()&#39;.

## Microkernels

MacOS and iOS use a microkernel architecture.  In these systems,
the kernel is a small, lightweight component that provides only the
essential services required for communication between hardware and
software, such as:

- Inter-process communication (IPC), usually via message passing
- Low-level hardware access

The rest of the operating system services, such as device drivers,
file systems, and network stacks, run in user space (ring 3) as
separate processes. This separation allows for better isolation,
security, and modularity.

# Fault Tolerance

Microkernels also provide for better failure isolation, as a crash in
one user-space process does not affect the entire system.  

This property of microkernels is important for decentralized systems,
where each agent may be running on a different machine or device and
where the agents are of variable reliability.

---

## Microkernel Message-Passing IPC

Perhaps the most important feature of microkernels is their use of
message-passing for inter-process communication (IPC).  In a
microkernel, instead of system calls like &#39;open()&#39;, &#39;read()&#39;, and
&#39;write()&#39;, processes communicate with each other by sending and
receiving messages.

## PromiseGrid as Decentralized Microkernel

Analogies between microkernel architectures and PromiseGrid:

| Feature | Microkernel | PromiseGrid |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| interprocess communication | message passing within same CPU | grid messages between agents |
| kernel | microkernel | PG kernel running on each grid node |
| services | device drivers, file systems, network stacks | agent services |
| process | user space process | agent |
| storage | local file system | IPFS |
| addressing | memory address | content address (CID) |

---

## It&#39;s Promises All The Way Down

An agent sending a PromiseGrid message is making this promise:

&gt; &#34;I promise that the following payload is a valid message according to the
&gt; protocol spec document identified by the protocol hash CID.&#34;

![:img Message, 60%](images/message.svg)

Protocol spec documents would typically be stored in IPFS or other
decentralized content-addressable storage systems for ease of
retrieval by developers and recipients.  

Unlike traditional protocols, where the protocol number is typically
assigned by a central authority such as IANA, the protocol hash CID
is a self-describing identifier gives us a world in which:

- Anyone can write a protocol spec document and publish it to IPFS.
- Anyone can write a PromiseGrid message that references the protocol
  spec document.

---

## PromiseGrid Messages

A PromiseGrid message consists of a nested CBOR structure with the following
components:

- A tag (0x67726964, ASCII &#39;grid&#39;) indicating the message is a PromiseGrid message
- A protocol hash CID that identifies the protocol spec document
- A message payload that contains the actual message data

![:img Message, 60%](images/message.svg)

Tag 0x67726964 (&#39;grid&#39;) will be registered with the Internet Assigned
Numbers Authority (IANA) as a CBOR tag.  

A &#39;CID&#39; (Content Identifier) is a unique identifier for content in
IPFS and compatible systems, including Bluesky.  

The protocol hash serves as a versioning mechanism, enabling future
updates without breaking existing implementations.  By using a hash
instead of a version number, we do not need a centralized registry for
protocol variants or versions.  

The payload can be anything that is valid according to the protocol spec
document identified by the protocol hash CID.  This allows for
flexibility in the types of messages that can be sent, while still
ensuring that the messages are valid and can be processed by the
recipient.

Ref: RFC-8949: CBOR https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949

## What is a CID?

A CID (Content Identifier) is a unique identifier for content in IPFS
and compatible systems.  CIDs solve the problem of needing to support
multiple hash algorithms and endcoding formats, including those not
yet invented.  CIDs are in use by IPFS, Bluesky, Filecoin,
and other decentralized systems.  A CID is a self-describing data
structure that contains information about the content, including:

- the version of the CID (currently CIDv0 or CIDv1)
- the content&#39;s multicodec (e.g., raw bytes, DAG-CBOR)
- the content&#39;s hash algorithm (e.g., SHA-256, SHA-512)
- the encoding format (e.g., base32, base58)
- the hash of the content itself

## What is an agent?

An agent is defined as an entity that can:

- cryptographically sign and send messages
- receive and verify the cryptographic signatures of messages

Agents can be humans, machines, or software processes.

This definition of &#39;agent&#39; is consistent with that of Promise Theory
(PT) in that &#34;agents cannot make promises on behalf of other agents&#34;.

---

## PromiseGrid Agents are a subset of Promise Theory Agents

As PromiseGrid is a practical implementation of Promise Theory,
the engineering constraints involved in building network and security
protocols mean that we need to choose a reasonable subset of Promise
Theory&#39;s definition of an agent.  In particular:

- A simple machine or subatomic particle does not have the mechanisms
  required to cryptographically sign or verify messages.
  - So a PG agent cannot be a simple machine or subatomic particle.

This diverges from Promise Theory&#39;s definition of an agent.  From the
book &#34;Thinking in Promises&#34;, page 9:

  Any agent (person, object, or machine) can harbour intentions. An
  intention might be something like “be red” for a [simple] light
  [...] When an intention is publicly declared to an audience (called
  its scope) it then becomes a promise.

Note:  Under US law, a promise is a legally binding agreement between two
or more parties.  When we say &#34;promise&#34; in the context of PromiseGrid, we are
referring to a technical promise, not a legal promise.  These
technical promises are roughly equivalent to a letter of intent --
Mark Burgess&#39; use of the word &#34;intention&#34; in the quote above is
useful here.

## IoT Integration Strategy
### Constrained Device Support
- Example minimum viable agent requirements:
  - Arduino UNO
    - 32KB RAM
    - ability to run sha256 hash algorithm
    - ability to run ed25519 signature algorithm

---

## Decentralized IoT Standard

Is it possible that the grid could serve as a generic IoT network
fabric similar in spirit to the local I2C bus?

MQTT and HTTP are both widely used protocols for IoT right now, but
they are not decentralized.  They rely on a centralized broker or
server to manage communication between devices.  

By comparison, a grid-based IoT network would allow devices to communicate
directly with each other without the need for a centralized broker or
server.  This would make the network more resilient and less
vulnerable to single points of failure.

---

## Next steps

A reasonable next step is to implement a &#39;hello world&#39; equivalent; an
example of remote execution of a simple function in a CLI demo:

- sender writes a simple WASM module that returns a &#39;hello world&#39; string
- sender compiles the module and stores it in IPFS, retaining the CID
  of  the module
- sender includes the CID in a message to a recipient
- recipient retrieves the module from IPFS using the CID
- recipient executes the module in a WASM runtime, seeing &#39;hello world&#39;

## Standardization Roadmap

- Start a draft RFC.  
  - This is a prereq for registering the &#39;grid&#39; tag with IANA.
  - https://www.rfc-editor.org/pubprocess/
- Register &#39;grid&#39; tag with IANA.  
  - https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml
- Create protocol documents that can be stored in IPFS and referenced
  by the protocol hash CID.  For example:
  - LLM API
  - wrapped MCP API
  - Scenario tree modeling
  - Personal currencies
  - Advisor/Executor model
  - IoT sensor data, e.g. optical encoder, temperature, humidity, etc.
  - CAD software agents -- solid modeling, simulation, etc.
  - ...
