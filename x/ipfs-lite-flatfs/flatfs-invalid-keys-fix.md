## How to Fix the Invalid Key Problem with FlatFS in Your Code

The **"invalid key"** error with FlatFS occurs because FlatFS only allows keys that match the pattern `/[0-9A-Z+-_=]+`-that is, only uppercase alphanumeric characters and `-`, `+`, `_`, `=` are allowed. **Namespaced keys** (those with slashes, like `/blocks/XYZ`) are *not* allowed[^3][^5]. If any part of your code or its dependencies tries to store such a key, FlatFS will panic or return an error.

### Why This Happens in Your Code

- **ipfs-lite** is generally safe, as it uses CIDs (which are conformant) as keys for block storage.
- However, if you use the *same FlatFS datastore* for other purposes (e.g., as a generic datastore for metadata, state, or anything that uses namespaced keys), you will hit this error.
- Some higher-level APIs or libraries may try to store keys like `/blocks/XYZ` or `/foo/bar`, which FlatFS will reject.

---

## Solution: Use FlatFS *Only* for Block Storage

**Do not use FlatFS as your general-purpose datastore.**

- Use FlatFS only as the blockstore (where CIDs are used as keys).
- For anything else (metadata, state, etc.), use a different datastore backend, such as Badger, LevelDB, or in-memory datastores, which support namespaced keys.


### How to Fix Your Code

#### 1. Use FlatFS Only for the Blockstore

- **ipfs-lite.New** accepts separate datastores for block storage and for metadata/state.
- Pass FlatFS only as the blockstore, and use a different, compatible datastore (e.g., Badger or LevelDB) for the rest.


#### 2. Example: Split Datastores

```go
import (
    // ... other imports
    badgerds "github.com/ipfs/go-ds-badger2"
    ds "github.com/ipfs/go-datastore"
)

// ... inside main()

// FlatFS for blockstore
fs, err := flatfs.CreateOrOpen(flatfsDir, shard, false)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
blockstoreDS := ds_sync.MutexWrap(fs)

// Badger for metadata/state
badgerDir := "/tmp/ipfs-lite-badger"
os.MkdirAll(badgerDir, 0755)
metaDS, err := badgerds.NewDatastore(badgerDir, &amp;badgerds.DefaultOptions)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

// Pass both to ipfs-lite
peer, err := ipfslite.New(ctx, blockstoreDS, metaDS, host, kaddht, nil)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```

- Here, `blockstoreDS` is your FlatFS instance (for blocks only), and `metaDS` is a Badger datastore for everything else.
- This ensures that only conformant keys go to FlatFS, and any namespaced keys (used for metadata, pinning, etc.) go to Badger.

---

## Summary Table

| Datastore Purpose | Backend to Use | Key Format Allowed |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Block Storage (blocks) | FlatFS | CIDs (conformant) |
| Metadata/State | Badger, LevelDB, etc. | Namespaced keys supported |


---

## Final Notes

- **Never use FlatFS as a general-purpose datastore**-only as a blockstore[^3][^5].
- If you must use a single datastore for everything, pick one that supports namespaced keys (not FlatFS).
- This split-datastore approach is standard in IPFS and is how go-ipfs and ipfs-lite are designed to work.

---

**Implementing this change will fix the invalid key problem and prevent FlatFS panics or errors in your application.**
