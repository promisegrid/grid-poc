## Measurement and Testing Framework

### Continuous Measurement
All success criteria must be continuously measurable through automated
testing and monitoring. The system must provide APIs and tooling for
real-time assessment of criterion compliance.

### Testing Methodology
Success criteria testing must follow these principles:
- **Automated**: All tests must be executable without human intervention
- **Reproducible**: Test results must be consistent across different environments
- **Comprehensive**: Tests must cover both normal operation and edge cases
- **Realistic**: Tests must use representative data and usage patterns

### Acceptance Thresholds
The system is considered successful when:
- **Critical Criteria**: 100% compliance with SC-001 through SC-015 (core functionality)
- **Performance Criteria**: ≥ 95% compliance with SC-016 through SC-022 (performance requirements)
- **Security Criteria**: 100% compliance with SC-023 through SC-026 (security requirements)
- **Operational Criteria**: ≥ 90% compliance with SC-028 through SC-034 (operational excellence)

### Failure Response
When success criteria are not met:
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify specific reasons for criterion failure
2. **Impact Assessment**: Determine effects on overall system functionality
3. **Remediation Plan**: Develop specific steps to achieve criterion compliance
4. **Re-testing**: Verify remediation through comprehensive testing
5. **Documentation**: Update documentation and procedures based on learnings

This comprehensive success criteria framework ensures that PromiseGrid
achieves its ambitious goals while maintaining practical usability and
operational excellence. The criteria balance innovation with
reliability, providing clear benchmarks for measuring the system's
effectiveness as a universal platform for modeling complex business
interactions.
