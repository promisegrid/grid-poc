# PromiseGrid Multi-Hop Routing Brainstorm

Below are 15 alternative designs for multi-hop routing in PromiseGrid. Each 
alternative builds upon ideas from ARP, routing tables with hints, promises, 
CID-based routing, layered routing assemblies, pub/sub systems, and additional 
novel strategies inspired by OSI/TCP-IP, Usenet, and UUCP mechanisms.

1. ARP-Inspired Dynamic Discovery  
   In this design, each node maintains an ARP-like table mapping peer 
   identifiers (CIDs or DIDs) to direct neighbor addresses. Nodes broadcast 
   lightweight "who-has" messages to discover reachable hops and update their 
   routing table dynamically, enabling rapid path discovery.

2. Extended Routing Table with Hints  
   Nodes maintain a routing table keyed by destination identifier (CID or DID) 
   but each entry contains routing hints. The hints are a set of potential 
   intermediate nodes or topics that suggest possible forwarding paths, 
   allowing adaptable routing decisions based on hint sets.

3. Promise/Claim Chain with Source Routing  
   A hybrid approach where each intermediate node makes an explicit promise 
   to forward messages for a given destination. A chain of these promises is 
   carried within the message, combining source routing with a UUCPnet-style 
   claim path that is verified cumulatively by each hop.

4. CID-Based Routing Algorithm  
   In this model the protocol CID is reinterpreted as a routing method CID. 
   Different CIDs specify distinct routing behaviors, for example one for direct 
   routing, another for multi-hop flooding, and yet another for promise-based 
   routing, providing flexibility within a single protocol suite.

5. Layered Node and Agent Routing  
   This design separates concerns into two layers: a node routing layer and an 
   agent routing layer. The node layer routes packets to the right host, while 
   the agent layer functions similarly to port addressing, ensuring messages 
   reach the correct process on every host.

6. Pub/Sub System with ARP-Like WhoHas/IHave Promises  
   In a pure publish/subscribe model, nodes publish interest topics and send 
   out whohas/ihave message chains. An ARP-like mechanism informs nodes which 
   peers are interested in which topics, so routing decisions are made on top of 
   dynamic interest registration rather than static tables.

7. Gossip-Based Overlay Routing  
   Nodes propagate routing hints using a gossip protocol. Each node shares 
   information about reachable destinations with a select group of peers. 
   This information creates an overlay network in which each node dynamically 
   selects the best multi-hop path via accumulated gossip data.

8. Flooding with Controlled Selective Repeat  
   Rather than maintaining extensive routing tables, intermediate nodes flood 
   messages to all connected peers while marking duplicate messages. A 
   selective repeat mechanism ensures that once a node recognizes a route it 
   can prune redundant paths while ensuring eventual delivery.

9. Distributed Hash Table (DHT) Assisted Routing  
   Borrowing from BitTorrent and other P2P systems, nodes use a DHT to store 
   and query routing hints. Each node can resolve a destination via a DHT lookup 
   and then forward the message along the discovered path, enabling decentralized 
   and scalable routing.

10. Multi-Path Bonding and Redundant Routing  
    This design uses multiple parallel routing paths. Each message is sent 
    redundantly over different hops and then the destination selects the first 
    correct arriving copy. Such redundancy ensures higher reliability in the 
    presence of dynamic network partitions.

11. Store-and-Forward Delay Tolerant Networking  
    Nodes store messages temporarily when the destination is not immediately 
    reachable and forward them when a suitable route becomes available. This is 
    analogous to delay tolerant networking where intermediate nodes act as caches, 
    ensuring eventual message delivery.

12. Hierarchical Routing with Proximity Awareness  
    A multi-tier grid is established where clusters of nodes form sub-grids. 
    Within each sub-grid, routing is handled by local coordinators while a 
    higher layer manages cross-grid routing. This hierarchy minimizes routing 
    table sizes and speeds up local delivery.

13. Hybrid Source and Hop Routing  
    Messages carry explicit source routes along with local hop hints. Each hop 
    can augment the route with its own best forwarding hints based on local 
    criteria. This hybrid approach combines the strengths of source routing and 
    dynamic hop-level decision making.

14. Real-Time Interest-Based Routing  
    Nodes propagate subscriptions and interests in real time. When a node has a 
    message for a given topic, it queries the network for nodes currently 
    subscribed to that topic. The resulting dynamic routing paths take into 
    account current node availability and interest levels.

15. Mesh Network Routing with Adaptive TTL  
    Inspired by mesh and sensor network protocols, each message is tagged with an 
    adaptive Time-To-Live (TTL) value. Every node decrements the TTL and drops the 
    message if it reaches zero. Hops dynamically adjust the TTL based on network 
    density and reliability, promoting balanced routing with controlled message 
    life spans.

These designs are intended as starting points, and further evaluation is needed 
to assess their trade-offs in terms of scalability, robustness, and latency in a 
real-world, multi-hop PromiseGrid deployment.
