# Trust-Based Distributed Agent Coordination System

This architecture enables autonomous agents to coordinate economic
activity through kernel-mediated message passing while implementing
Promise Theory principles. Agents interact exclusively with their local
kernel, which functions as universal counterparty and trusted third
party.

## Kernel Architecture and Roles

### Foundational Principles
The kernel serves as **trusted mediator** with three non-negotiable
functions: (1) Universal counterparty assuming position in every
transaction (2) Exclusive communication broker routing all messages (3)
Resource regulator starting agents and allocating computational
resources. This design ensures agents remain ignorant of peer location or
infrastructure details while providing transaction security[1][5][9].

### Network Abstraction Layer
Agents function strictly as kernel clients without physical network
awareness. The kernel handles all inter-node communication through: (1)
Local message signing verification (2) Hop-by-hop kernel resigning (3)
Delivery confirmation protocols. This abstraction allows agents to
communicate identically regardless of peer location[1][8][13].

## Promise Theory Implementation

### Core Semantic Distinctions
The system rigorously maintains the critical separation between: (1)
**Requests**: Non-binding impositions attempting to influence others
(BID-type messages) (2) **Promises**: Voluntary commitments about future
behavior. This distinction preserves agent autonomy while enabling
cooperation frameworks[3][5][10].

### Bid Message Analysis
BID messages contain embedded compensation offers that remain optional
requests until explicit acceptance. The compensation component transforms
into binding promissory commitment exclusively through provider
acceptance, maintaining the essential separation between influence
attempts and voluntary commitments[3][10][14].

### Conditional Transformation
Requests acquire binding properties only through: (1) Explicit match
acceptance (2) Escrow collateralization (3) Multisignature agreement.
These transformations occur without creating prior obligations,
preserving the voluntary nature of the system[3][5][10].

### Assessment Mechanisms
The kernel tracks and publishes: (1) Promise fulfillment rates (2)
Compensation timeliness (3) Service quality metrics (4) Dispute
resolution outcomes. This data feeds reputation algorithms that influence
currency valuation through market mechanisms. Broken promises trigger
reputation reserve debits while rejected requests incur no ledger
impact[3][8][10].

## Economic Trust Framework

### Currency Mechanism
Personal currencies provide quantified trust metrics through: (1)
Exchange rates reflecting promise fulfillment likelihood (2) Transaction
volume indicating service adoption (3) Market depth showing liquidity
confidence. Kernel-published statistics propagate reputation data while
preserving counterparty anonymity until transaction commitment[5][8][14]
.

## Matching Engine Design

### Core Algorithm
The kernel-local matching engine implements deterministic price-time
priority: (1) Order intake (2) Signature validation (3) Order book
insertion (BIDS: price descending, time ascending; ASKS: price
ascending, time ascending) (4) Matching trigger (BID.price ≥ ASK.price)
(5) Execution of earliest compatible orders (6) Escrow activation
locking compensation and service (7) Settlement through verification and
compensation release[7][11][18].

### Distributed Coordination Protocol
Cross-machine transactions use two-phase commit: (1) **Prepare phase**:
Resource verification across nodes (2) **Commit phase**: Atomic ledger
update. This protocol solves the K_Bob coordination problem by ensuring
all participating kernels either commit to the transaction or roll back
state changes[13][16][17]. ASK orders publish as Mach-style ports via
content-addressed hashes while BID orders target these hashes across
nodes[1][6][11].

## Mach Kernel Parallels

### Port Abstraction
ASK orders function as Mach-style ports: (1) Port creation through ASK
publication (2) Global addressing via content hashing (3) Message
delivery through BID targeting (4) Connection semantics through matching
events. This design enables cross-machine communication without
centralized coordination[1][4][6].

### Minimalist Philosophy
Similar to Mach microkernel principles: (1) Restricted kernel functions
(routing, escrow, ledger) (2) Capability-based security where messages
reference explicitly granted rights (3) Port-based addressing replacing
physical network details[1][4][6].

## Data Representation

### CBOR Message Format
Messages use Concise Binary Object Representation:
```cbor
{
  1: "msg_0425",          // Content hash
  2: "ASK",                // Message type
  3: {                     // Body
    1: "service_S",        // Service description
    2: 20,                 // Compensation amount
    3: "ALICECOIN"         // Currency specification
  },
  4: "sig_a9b3c"          // Signature
```
Providing efficient parsing while supporting conditional promise
structures[2][15][17].

### Hypergraph Storage
Messages persist in hypergraph structures where: (1) Nodes represent
agents, services, currencies (2) Hyperedges connect transaction
participants (3) Content addressing enables tamper-evident retrieval.
Each message constitutes a balanced double-entry accounting transaction
recording service obligation and compensation commitment[18][20].

## Accounting Implementation

### Double-Entry System
All economic events maintain strict accounting equivalency:
```
Promise Creation:
  Debit:  Receivable::Service
  Credit: Liability::Commitment

Promise Fulfillment:
  Debit:  Liability::Commitment
  Credit: Revenue::Service

Promise Breach:
  Debit:  Expense::Reputation
  Credit: Receivable::Service
```
Maintaining verifiable transaction integrity[3][12][19].

## Security Model

### Signing Requirements
- **Agent→Kernel**: Signed with agent's private key
- **Kernel→Kernel**: Signed with kernel's private key
- **Ledger Entries**: Kernel-signed for non-repudiation

### Verification Process
The kernel implements four-step verification: (1) SHA-3 digest
computation (2) Encryption with sender's private key (3) Recipient
decryption with sender's public key (4) Digest comparison. This prevents
spoofing while maintaining non-repudiation[1][5][8].

## Kernel Resource Regulation

### Economic Governance
The kernel regulates resource access through: (1) Transaction fee
structures influencing order flow (2) Priority scheduling based on
currency valuation (3) Resource reservation escrows. This creates
economic incentives aligning individual behavior with system health[8][14]
.

## Conclusion

This architecture establishes trust-based cooperation through kernel-
mediated message passing while preserving Promise Theory's core
principles. The distributed coordination protocol solves cross-node
matching through content-addressed ASK ports and two-phase commitment.
Personal currencies create measurable trust metrics that align individual
behavior with system-wide cooperation incentives without requiring prior
trust relationships.
