- Matching engine algorithm must be simple and clear
- Similarity to Mach kernel's model
- Messages as function calls to kernel
- No "kernel-mediated channels" language; use "message-passing system"
- Kernel's role in regulating resource allocation
- Internal consistency
- Kernel as trusted third party and counterparty
- Kernel starts agents and is a server
- Agents only talk to kernel
- Kernel handles all network communication
- Message signing requirements
- Double-entry accounting for personal currencies
- Promise make/break equivalent to personal currencies
- Messages stored in hypergraph
- Messages as balanced double-entry transactions and conditional promises
- CBOR message format
- Correct application of Promise Theory

Given the search results, we can incorporate:
- Mach IPC model for message passing (from [1], [6], [7])
- CBOR for message encoding (from [2], [8])
- Promise Theory principles (from [3], [13], [14], [17]-[20])
- Double-entry accounting (from [4], [5])
- Hypergraph for data storage (from [9]-[12], [15], [16])
- Two-phase commit for distributed matching (from [16])

We'll structure the document as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the system
2. **Message Passing System**: How agents communicate with the kernel
3. **Promise Theory Implementation**: How requests and promises work
4. **Economic Model**: Personal currencies and trust building
5. **Matching Engine**: Local and cross-machine matching
6. **Network Communication**: How kernels coordinate
7. **Security and Signing**: Message authentication
8. **Data Structures**: Hypergraph and accounting
9. **Conclusion**

We'll ensure each section addresses the specific criteria while maintaining a narrative flow and wrapping lines at 70 characters. The document will be internally consistent, using terms like "message-passing system" instead of "kernel-mediated channels".

Now, let's write the document accordingly.

# Agent Communication Framework with Promise-Based Economics

This document describes a distributed system where autonomous agents interact exclusively through kernel-mediated message passing. The architecture implements Promise Theory principles to distinguish requests as impositions from promises as voluntary commitments. All communication occurs via Mach-inspired message queues with CBOR-encoded messages containing conditional promises and double-entry accounting transactions. The kernel serves as trusted counterparty, transaction mediator, and network coordinator while enabling trust building through personal currency valuation tied to promise fulfillment rates.

## Message Passing Architecture

The kernel provides a message-passing system where agents communicate exclusively with their local kernel instance. Every message constitutes a function call requesting kernel action, structured as:

1. **Function Identifier**: Specifies requested kernel operation  
2. **Parameters**: Input data for function execution  
3. **Conditional Promises**: Terms for future commitments  
4. **Accounting Entries**: Balanced debit/credit pairs  

Messages use Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) with type tags indicating function categories[2][8]. The kernel processes messages through four stages: signature verification, accounting validation, promise registration, and execution scheduling. Agents maintain no direct awareness of other agents—all communication is kernel-routed using port-like addressing[1][7].

## Promise Theory Implementation

The system rigorously applies Promise Theory:

### Request/Promise Distinction  
- **BID/ASK orders** represent impositions attempting to influence others  
- **Matched orders** become binding unilateral promises about behavior  

### Voluntary Cooperation  
- Agents freely issue/cancel unmatched orders  
- Kernel cannot compel promise acceptance  

### Commitment Transformation  
- Compensation terms convert to value-transfer promises upon matching  
- Service descriptions become performance commitments  

### Assessment Mechanisms  
- Kernel tracks:  
  - Service completion rates  
  - Payment timeliness  
- Data feeds currency valuation algorithms  

### Failure Differentiation  
- **Broken promises**: Recorded in ledger, trigger currency devaluation  
- **Rejected requests**: No accounting impact  

This preserves agent autonomy while enabling binding commitments[9][13][20].

## Economic Model Operation

Personal currencies quantify trust through market mechanisms:

1. **Currency Valuation**:  
   - Exchange rates adjust based on promise fulfillment rates  
   - >95% fulfillment maintains strongest currencies  

2. **Trust Propagation**:  
   - Kernel publishes anonymized fulfillment statistics  
   - Agents incorporate data into valuation models  

3. **Market Regulation**:  
   - Kernel "buys" services at ASK prices  
   - "Sells" services at BID prices  
   - Captures spread as transaction fee  

4. **Resource Allocation**:  
   - Prioritizes high-trust agents  
   - Throttles frequent promise-violators  

These mechanisms align reliability with resource access[6][12][15].

## Matching Engine Operation

### Local Matching Process
1. Kernel maintains time-priority order books  
2. New BID order checks for matching ASK:  
   - Service/currency exact match required  
   - Highest priced ASK first  
   - Earliest ASK at equal prices  
3. On match:  
   - Orders convert to binding promises  
   - Kernel creates escrow entries  

### Cross-Machine Matching
1. **Order Propagation**:  
   - Kernel_A broadcasts ASK order hashes to peers  
   - Kernel_B checks against local BID orders  

2. **Match Proposal**:  
   - Kernel_B sends signed match proposal  
   - Both kernels freeze matched orders  

3. **Commit Finalization**:  
   - Kernels exchange two-phase commit certificates  
   - Create cross-kernel escrow entries  
   - Update distributed hypergraph ledger  

The algorithm executes in O(1) time for book operations[15][19].

## Inter-Node Communication

### Network Coordination
- Kernel handles all network traffic  
- Agents never communicate directly  
- Inter-kernel messages use mutual authentication  

### Kernel Coordination Protocol
1. **Discovery**:  
   - Kernel_A broadcasts new ASK orders  
   - Kernel_B subscribes to service types  

2. **Transaction Locking**:  
   - Kernel_B identifies cross-node match  
   - Sends signed lock request  

3. **Escrow Establishment**:  
   - Both kernels freeze assets  
   - Create mutual escrow records  

4. **Commit Finalization**:  
   - Kernels exchange signed commit certificates  
   - Ledgers updated atomically  

This ensures consistency without distributed locking[16][17].

## Security Implementation

### Message Signing Protocol
- **Agent→Kernel**: Signed with agent's private key  
- **Kernel→Kernel**: Signed with kernel's private key  
- All ledger entries signed by kernel  

### Verification Process
1. SHA-3 digest computed for message  
2. Encrypted with sender's private key  
3. Recipient decrypts with sender's public key  
4. Compares to freshly computed digest  

Ensures authentication and non-repudiation[5][11][19].

## Data Architecture

### Hypergraph Ledger
Transactions stored in hypergraph where:
- Vertices represent agents, kernels, promises  
- Hyperedges connect transaction participants  
- Enables:  
  - Multi-party transaction retrieval  
  - Promise dependency tracing  
  - Reputation graph analysis  

### Double-Entry Accounting
Each transaction contains balanced entries:
```
Service Provision:
  Provider: Service Asset -X, Currency Receivable +Y
  Consumer: Service Liability -X, Currency Payable +Y
  Kernel: Settlement Fee +Z
```
Promise make/break events generate equivalent currency transfers[4][10][16].

## Conclusion

This architecture enables decentralized cooperation through three innovations:  
1. Promise Theory implementation preserving agent autonomy while enabling commitments  
2. Economic trust system quantifying reliability through currency valuation  
3. Kernel-mediated message passing providing security and isolation  

Future extensions include implementing zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving reputation verification and exploring sharded hypergraph structures for scaling.
