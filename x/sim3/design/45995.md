5. BID/ASK mechanics as Mach ports/messages
6. Matching engine design
7. Double-entry accounting for promises
8. CBOR message format

# Kernel-Centric Agent Coordination System

This architecture implements a distributed coordination system where 
autonomous agents interact exclusively through local kernel instances. 
The kernel facilitates trust-building through Promise Theory principles 
and personal currency economics while ensuring secure, tamper-evident 
communication via hypergraph-structured messaging.

## Kernel Architecture

### Foundational Roles
The kernel serves as:
- **Trusted Third Party**: Provides cryptographic attestation for all 
  transactions
- **Universal Counterparty**: Assumes settlement responsibility in all 
  trades
- **Resource Allocator**: Starts agents and manages computational 
  resources
- **Communication Broker**: Handles all message routing between agents

Agents function strictly as kernel clients, initiating interactions 
solely through kernel-mediated message passing[1][5][6]. This design 
ensures agents maintain no direct awareness of peer location or 
infrastructure details.

## Communication Model

### Agent-Kernel Exclusivity
All interactions follow the pattern:
```
Agent → Kernel: Signed request (e.g., BID/ASK message)
Kernel → Peer Kernel: Routed with kernel attestation
Peer Kernel → Target Agent: Delivers verified message
```
This answers critical design questions:
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Agents communicate exclusively through 
  kernel message passing
- **Network Handling**: Kernel manages routing, discovery, and 
  transport security
- **Signing Requirements**: Local messages require agent signatures; 
  inter-kernel messages add kernel routing signatures

## Promise Theory Implementation

### Core Principles
The system enforces ontological separation between:
- **Requests**: Non-binding impositions attempting influence
- **Promises**: Voluntary commitments about future behavior

BID-type messages contain compensation offers that transform into 
binding promises only upon explicit acceptance:
```
+------------------+------------------------+-------------------------+
| Component        | Nature                 | Binding Condition       |
+------------------+------------------------+-------------------------+
| Service Request  | Non-binding imposition | Counterparty acceptance |
| Compensation     | Value-transfer promise | Execution contingent    |
+------------------+------------------------+-------------------------+
```

### Promise Transformation
Requests become promises under specific conditions:
1. **Matching Event**: Mutual agreement converts proposals to 
   commitments
2. **Escrow Activation**: Compensation lock creates binding obligation
3. **Service Initiation**: Performance obligation begins

### Trust Assessment
The kernel tracks:
- Promise fulfillment rates
- Compensation transfer timeliness
- Service quality metrics
This data informs personal currency valuation algorithms[3][7].

## Economic System

### Currency Mechanism
Personal currencies quantify trust through:
```
Trust Metric        | Currency Impact
-------------------------------------
Promise fulfillment | Exchange rate appreciation
Service quality     | Transaction volume increase
Compensation speed  | Market depth improvement
```
Agents trade peer currencies based on履约 history, creating incentive 
alignment[4][8].

## Matching Engine

### Algorithm Implementation
The kernel employs price-time priority:
```
1. Ingest signed BID/ASK messages
2. Validate signatures and balances
3. Sort orders:
   - BIDS: Descending price
   - ASKS: Ascending price
4. Match when BID.price >= ASK.price
5. Execute sequentially:
   a. Lock compensation in escrow
   b. Transfer service obligation
   c. Atomically settle upon completion
6. Update ledger with double-entry transaction
```

### Distributed Coordination
For cross-machine matches (Option C):
1. K_Alice broadcasts ASK hash
2. K_Bob detects match with local BID
3. Two-phase commit protocol:
   - Prepare: Resource verification
   - Commit: Atomic ledger update
4. Hypergraph records transaction
This prevents double-spend without centralized locking[2][6].

## Data Representation

### CBOR Encoding
Messages use Concise Binary Object Representation:
```cbor
{
  1: "msg_0425",          // Content hash
  2: "ASK",                // Message type
  3: {                     // Body
    1: "service_S",        // Service description
    2: 20,                 // Compensation amount
    3: "ALICECOIN"         // Currency specification
  }
}
```
Each message constitutes:
- **Conditional Promise**: Service/compensation commitment
- **Balanced Transaction**: Double-entry accounting primitive
- **Hypergraph Component**: Stored as hyperedge[5][9]

## Mach Kernel Similarities

The architecture adopts Mach principles:
1. **Message Passing**: Fundamental communication primitive
2. **Port Abstraction**: Service endpoints replace Mach ports
3. **Microkernel Design**: Strict process isolation
4. **Capability Security**: Rights-based resource access[1][4]

## Conclusion

This system enables trust-based cooperation through kernel-mediated 
message passing and Promise Theory economics. The matching engine 
implementation provides efficient distributed coordination while the 
hypergraph ledger ensures tamper-evident recording. Personal 
currencies create quantifiable trust metrics that align individual 
behavior with collective cooperation incentives.
