We are creating a new file that combines the best parts of two existing files while meeting the specified fitness criteria. The fitness criteria emphasize narrative flow, line wrapping, Promise Theory implementation, and addressing specific technical questions.

Key elements to cover:
1. Agents communicate only through the kernel (client-server model)
2. Kernel acts as trusted third party and counterparty
3. Message passing as function calls
4. Promise Theory distinctions (requests vs promises)
5. BID/ASK mechanics as Mach ports/messages
6. Matching engine design
7. Double-entry accounting for promises
8. CBOR message format
9. Hypergraph storage
10. Distributed communication solution

We'll structure the document as:

# Kernel-Mediated Agent Coordination System

This architecture implements a distributed coordination system where 
autonomous agents interact exclusively through local kernel instances. 
The kernel facilitates trust-building through Promise Theory 
principles and personal currency economics while ensuring secure, 
tamper-evident communication via hypergraph-structured messaging.

## Kernel Architecture

### Foundational Roles
The kernel serves as:
- **Trusted Third Party**: Provides cryptographic attestation for 
  all transactions
- **Universal Counterparty**: Assumes settlement responsibility in 
  all trades
- **Resource Allocator**: Starts agents and manages computational 
  resources
- **Message Broker**: Handles all inter-agent communication

Agents function strictly as kernel clients, initiating interactions 
solely through kernel-mediated message passing[1][5][6]. This design 
ensures agents maintain no awareness of peer location or 
infrastructure details.

## Communication Protocol

### Exclusivity Principle
All interactions follow the pattern:
```
Agent → Kernel: Signed request (e.g., BID/ASK creation)
Kernel → Peer Kernel: Routed with kernel attestation
Peer Kernel → Target Agent: Delivers verified message
```
This answers critical design questions:
- **Agent Communication**: Agents communicate exclusively via kernel
- **Network Handling**: Kernel manages routing and transport
- **Signing Requirements**: Local messages require agent signatures; 
  inter-kernel messages add kernel attestation

## Promise Theory Implementation

### Fundamental Distinctions
The system maintains strict separation between:
- **Requests**: Non-binding impositions seeking behavioral change
- **Promises**: Voluntary commitments about future actions

### Bid Semantic Analysis
BID-type messages contain:
1. **Service Request**: Non-binding attempt to influence provider
2. **Compensation Promise**: Binding upon explicit acceptance

### Transformation Mechanics
Requests become promises through:
1. **Matching Event**: Mutual agreement converts proposals
2. **Escrow Activation**: Collateral deposit verification
3. **Condition Satisfaction**: Predefined criteria fulfillment

### Assessment Framework
The kernel tracks:
- Promise fulfillment rates
- Compensation timeliness
- Service quality metrics
Data feeds into personal currency valuation[3][8][14].

## Economic Trust Model

### Currency Mechanism
Personal currencies quantify trust through:
```
Trust Metric        | Currency Impact
-------------------------------------
Promise fulfillment | Exchange rate appreciation
Service quality     | Transaction volume increase
Compensation speed  | Market depth improvement
```

### Reputation Propagation
- Kernel publishes anonymized fulfillment statistics
- Agents incorporate third-party data into valuation models
- Direct interaction history receives maximum weighting[4][10]

## Matching Engine

### Core Algorithm
```
1. Order intake (BID/ASK messages)
2. Signature validation
3. Order book insertion:
   - BIDS: Descending price → ascending time
   - ASKS: Ascending price → ascending time
4. Matching trigger: BID.price ≥ ASK.price
5. Execution: Earliest compatible orders first
6. Escrow activation:
   - Kernel locks compensation
   - Service obligation transferred
7. Settlement:
   - Service delivery verification
   - Compensation release
   - Ledger update
```

### Distributed Coordination
Cross-machine transactions use two-phase commit:
```
Phase 1: Resource verification (Prepare)
Phase 2: Atomic ledger update (Commit)
```
Transaction recorded as hypergraph edge[7][19].

## Data Representation

### CBOR Message Format
Messages use Concise Binary Object Representation:
```cbor
{
  1: "msg_0425",          // Content hash
  2: "ASK",                // Message type
  3: {                     // Body
    1: "service_S",        // Service description
    2: 20,                 // Compensation amount
    3: "ALICECOIN"         // Currency specification
  },
  4: "sig_a9b3c"          // Signature
```
Each message constitutes:
- **Conditional Promise**: Service/compensation commitment
- **Balanced Transaction**: Double-entry accounting primitive
- **Hypergraph Component**: Stored as hyperedge[5][9]

## Mach Kernel Similarities

### Port-Message Paradigm
- **ASK Orders as Ports**: Service endpoints replace Mach ports
- **BID Orders as Messages**: Targeted service invocations
- **Hash Addressing**: Enables cross-machine delivery[1][4][6]

### Microkernel Design
- Minimal privileged operations
- Strict process isolation
- Capability-based security[11][16]

## Conclusion

This system enables decentralized cooperation through kernel-mediated 
message passing with Promise Theory economics. The matching engine 
implementation provides efficient distributed coordination while the 
hypergraph ledger ensures tamper-evident recording. Personal 
currencies create quantifiable trust metrics that align individual 
behavior with system-wide cooperation incentives.
