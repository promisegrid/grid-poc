# Distributed Agent System with Promise-Based Messaging Architecture

## Core Architectural Principles

The system implements a **kernel-centric design** where every agent interacts exclusively with its local kernel through message passing[1][4][7]. Kernels function as trusted intermediaries that coordinate all economic activity while maintaining complete agent isolation. This architecture ensures agents possess no awareness of peer existence beyond cryptographic identifiers, with kernels providing:

1. **Trusted Third Party Services**: Cryptographic attestation and state synchronization
2. **Resource Mediation**: Allocation of computational resources
3. **Market Infrastructure**: Order matching and settlement enforcement
4. **Network Routing**: Cross-node message delivery[3][5][14]

Agents function strictly as kernel clients, initiating communication only through authenticated requests to their local kernel instance[5][8][13].

## Communication Model Implementation

### Agent-Kernel Exclusivity
All interactions follow the strict pattern:
```plaintext
Agent → Kernel: Signed Request 
Kernel → Target Kernel: Routed Message (if remote)
Kernel → Target Agent: Delivered Request
Agent → Kernel: Signed Response
Kernel → Original Agent: Forwarded Response
```
This satisfies critical design constraints:
- **Network Handling**: Kernels manage routing tables and discovery protocols[4][8]
- **Agent Awareness**: Agents reference others via cryptographic IDs without direct knowledge[3][13]
- **Signing Requirements**:
  - Local messages: Signed with agent's private key
  - Network messages: Double-signed (agent + kernel)[5][8][11]

### Promise Theory Implementation
The architecture enforces Burgess' voluntary cooperation principles:
1. **Request/Promise Distinction**:
   - BID/ASK messages: Non-binding impositions
   - Matched orders: Become binding commitments
2. **Freedom Preservation**:
   - Unmatched orders freely cancellable
   - Agents select counterparties algorithmically
3. **Economic Transformation**:
   - Compensation offers become binding upon acceptance
   - Service commitments activate upon escrow lock[5][10][13]

### Trust Establishment
Trust emerges through observable promise fulfillment:
1. **Public Ledger**: Records all promise make/break events
2. **Currency Valuation**: Fulfillment rates determine exchange rates
3. **Reputation Premiums**: Reliable agents command higher compensation[6][10][17]

## Matching Engine Design

### Core Algorithm
The kernel implements FIFO price-time priority matching:
```
1. Collect BID/ASK orders
2. Validate signatures and balances
3. Sort orders:
   - BIDs: Descending price, then arrival time
   - ASKs: Ascending price, then arrival time
4. While BID.price >= ASK.price:
   a. Lock compensation in escrow
   b. Transfer service obligation
   c. Generate binding promise contract
5. Broadcast completion events[15][18][21]
```

### Cross-Node Matching Protocol
When Kernel_B identifies remote match:
```plaintext
1. Locking Phase:
   - Kernel_B → Kernel_A: Signed match proposal
   - Both kernels freeze relevant orders

2. Escrow Establishment:
   - Kernel_A: Creates service obligation escrow
   - Kernel_B: Creates compensation escrow

3. Atomic Commitment:
   - Kernels exchange signed commitment certificates
   - Escrows convert to binding promises
   - Ledgers updated atomically[16][19][23]
```
This two-phase locking prevents inconsistent state across nodes.

## Economic Regulation Mechanism

The kernel regulates resource allocation through market operations:
1. **Price Discovery**: Aggregates BID/ASK spreads
2. **Liquidity Provision**: Acts as automated market maker
3. **Flow Regulation**:
   - Buys services at ASK prices (low)
   - Sells services at BID prices (high)
   - Captures spreads to prioritize high-value transactions[15][16]

## Double-Entry Promise Accounting

The kernel maintains personal currencies using balanced accounting:
```
+-----------------------+-------------------------+------------------------+
| Transaction           | Debit                   | Credit                 |
+-----------------------+-------------------------+------------------------+
| Promise Made (Service)| Service Receivable      | Commitment Liability    |
| Promise Kept          | Commitment Liability    | Service Revenue        |
| Promise Broken        | Reputation Reserve      | Service Receivable     |
+-----------------------+-------------------------+------------------------+
```
Promise make/break events directly map to currency operations, establishing 
financial equivalence[9].

## Hypergraph Message Storage

All messages persist in hypergraph structures where:
- Nodes represent agents, kernels, promises
- Hyperedges connect transaction participants
- Content addressing enables tamper-evident retrieval[9][14][18]

## CBOR Message Specification

Messages use Concise Binary Object Representation:
```cbor
{
  1: "msg_0425",             // Message ID
  2: {                        // Payload
    1: {                      // Request
      1: "compute_result"     // Action
    },
    2: {                      // Offer
      1: {                    // Compensation
        1: 1500               // Amount
      }
    },
    3: {                      // Conditions
      1: "recipient_accepts" // Activation clause
    }
  }
}
```
Every message constitutes a **conditional promise** with dual properties:
1. **Balanced Accounting Entry**: Debits and credits sum to zero
2. **Contingent Obligation**: Activation requires explicit conditions[3][5]

## Mach Kernel Similarities

The architecture shares fundamental principles with Mach microkernel:
1. **Port Abstraction**: ASK orders function as virtual ports
2. **Capability Security**: Messages reference explicitly granted rights
3. **Minimal Kernel**: Core limited to IPC and resource control
4. **Userspace Services**: Matching engine operates outside kernel core[1][4][7]

## Direct Question Resolution

### "How do agents communicate?"
Exclusively through kernel-mediated message passing using public key addressing[5][8][13]

### "How is trust built?"
Through:
1. Public promise fulfillment history
2. Staked compensation backing promises
3. Graduated engagement limits[5][10][17]

### "What happens on cross-node match?"
Kernel_B initiates two-phase commit:
1. Proposes match with signed proof
2. Coordinates escrow locks
3. Atomically updates both ledgers[16]
