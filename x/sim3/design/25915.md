We are merging two files (29800.md and 28410.md) into a new file named 'c842c16091fd672155b6e03d290774761da440a2c902dd5e0befa95fee04bc7c.md'. We must follow all formatting rules and meet all fitness criteria.

Key observations:
- Both files cover similar concepts but with different emphases
- 29800.md has stronger kernel-as-counterparty implementation
- 28410.md has better Promise Theory details
- Both meet the double-entry accounting requirement
- Both implement message passing similar to Mach kernel

Integration strategy:
1. Use 29800.md as structural foundation due to its comprehensive kernel architecture
2. Incorporate 28410.md's superior Promise Theory treatment
3. Merge the accounting sections from both files
4. Preserve 29800.md's answers to required questions
5. Enhance with 28410.md's economic dimensions analysis
6. Maintain paragraph-based narrative with 70-character line wrapping

The integrated document will include:
1. Introduction combining both frameworks
2. Kernel Role section with trusted third party and counterparty functions
3. Communication Topology with explicit answers to agent/kernel questions
4. Message Security with signing requirements
5. Promise Theory Implementation covering all specified dimensions
6. Accounting with double-entry tables
7. CBOR Specification with improved examples
8. Hypergraph storage details
9. Conclusion synthesizing both approaches

We'll ensure all fitness criteria are met:
- 70-character line wrapping
- Paragraph-based narrative flow
- Clear answers to all questions
- Promise Theory tenets correctly applied
- CBOR format described
- Internal consistency maintained

The final file will be a valid markdown document exceeding 10,000 words.

# Unified Agent-Kernel Architecture with Promise-Based Economics

## Kernel as Central Counterparty and Trust Infrastructure

The kernel operates as the **mandatory settlement counterparty** for all economic transactions between agents, implementing Mach's message-passing model where every message represents a function call requesting kernel services[3][6][8][9]. This design eliminates bilateral counterparty risk while preserving agent autonomy through voluntary service adoption. As counterparty, the kernel provides atomic swap enforcement, liquidity provisioning, and cryptographic proof of settlement. As trust infrastructure, it delivers tamper-evident interaction logging, hardware-backed confidential computation, and capability-based access control. Agents freely select kernel services based on verifiable attestations, implementing Promise Theory's voluntary cooperation principle where trust emerges from observable actions rather than imposed authority[5][15][16]. This kernel-centric architecture ensures all economic operations clear through a single trusted third party while preventing systemic failure through Byzantine Fault Tolerant coordination between kernel instances[1][3][9].

## Communication Exclusivity and Network Handling

We need to figure out how agents communicate with each other, and how
trust is built over time in a community.
