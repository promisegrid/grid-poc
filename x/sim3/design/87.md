# Agent Coordination System: Promise-Based Economy with Kernel Mediation

This system establishes a framework where autonomous agents coordinate through voluntary promises mediated by a trusted kernel infrastructure. The architecture combines Promise Theory principles with economic mechanisms where personal currencies quantify trust relationships. All agent interactions occur exclusively through kernel-managed channels, with the kernel providing identity verification, transaction notarization, and communication routing while explicitly avoiding obligation assumption. Trust emerges from observable promise-keeping behavior reflected in currency valuations[3][9][13].

## System Architecture

### Kernel Functions
The kernel operates as **trusted infrastructure** providing:
- **Agent lifecycle management**: Starting, monitoring, and terminating agents
- **Communication mediation**: Routing all inter-agent messages
- **Identity verification**: Cryptographic signature validation
- **Transaction notarization**: Immutable ledger maintenance[1][7][17]
Agents function exclusively as **kernel clients**, interacting only through:
- Mach-inspired message ports (ASK orders as listening ports)
- Atomic transaction interfaces
- Identity-verified channels[1][4][8]

### Network Communication
The kernel handles **all network routing** through:
- Content-addressable message IDs (hash-based port addressing)
- Hybrid transport: kernel-mediated negotiation with optional direct data transfer
- End-to-end encryption with kernel routing signatures[1][8][12]
This answers critical design questions:
- **Inter-node communication**: Kernel instances coordinate via two-phase commit
- **Agent knowledge**: Agents know only kernel interfaces, not peers
- **Network handling**: Kernel manages all network routing
- **Message signing**: Local messages signed by originator; network messages add kernel routing signature[1][7][8]

## Promise Theory Implementation

### Request-Promise Distinction
The system enforces **ontological separation**:
- **BID messages**: Non-binding impositions containing optional compensation offers
- **ASK messages**: Binding commitments to provide specified services
- **Compensation acceptance**: Transforms offer into binding promise[9][11][13]
This preserves agent autonomy while enabling:
- Voluntary participation in economic exchanges
- Clear distinction between influence attempts and commitments
- Mutual agreement as binding precondition[2][5][10]

### Economic Trust Building
Personal currencies implement **quantified trust metrics**:
```
Alice's Trust Score = (Promises Kept) / (Promises Made)
Bob's Valuation of Alice = f(Alice's Trust Score, Historical Interactions)
```
Agents build trust through:
- Observable promise fulfillment history
- Currency exchange rate fluctuations
- Reputation staking mechanisms[6][13][16]
This creates economic incentives for reliable behavior while preserving the voluntary cooperation framework[3][6][9].

## Communication Protocols

### ASK Orders as Mach Ports
ASK orders implement **content-addressable ports**:
1. Agent creates ASK order hashed as H(service_description)
2. Kernel registers H(service_description) as globally addressable port
3. BID orders specify target port hash for routing[1][7]
This enables:
- Decentralized service discovery
- Hash-based cross-machine addressing
- Port-like semantics for service endpoints[1][7][17]

### Cross-Machine Coordination
For inter-node matching:
1. K_Bob identifies matching ASK(H(service))
2. Initiates two-phase commit protocol:
   - **Prepare phase**: Locks resources across kernels
   - **Commit phase**: Atomic ledger updates
3. Successful commit triggers:
   - Service execution by asker
   - Compensation transfer
   - Ledger synchronization[19]
This solves the match coordination problem through transaction locking while maintaining kernel's trusted mediator role[19].

## Accounting System

### Double-Entry Implementation
Each transaction records **balanced entries**:
```
[Alice's Ledger]
Debit: Service Receivable (Bob) 20 ALICE
Credit: Unearned Revenue         20 ALICE

[Kernel's Ledger]
Debit: Alice_Currency_Escrow     20 ALICE
Credit: Bob_Payment_Obligation   20 ALICE
```
Promise make/break events create equivalent entries:
- Promise made: Debit Promise Receivable, Credit Promise Liability
- Promise kept: Debit Promise Liability, Credit Revenue
- Promise broken: Debit Reputation Reserve, Credit Promise Receivable[10][14][16]

### Hypergraph Storage
Messages stored in **hypergraph structure** with:
- Nodes: Agents, messages, currency units
- Hyperedges: Transaction relationships
- Content addressing: Cryptographic hash pointers[6][18]
This enables efficient:
- Promise dependency tracking
- Cross-transaction auditing
- Temporal relationship mapping[6][18]

## Operational Mechanics

### Matching Algorithm
The **order matching engine** operates as:
```python
def match_orders(bids, asks):
    sorted_bids = sort_bids_descending(bids)
    sorted_asks = sort_asks_ascending(asks)
    
    while sorted_bids and sorted_asks:
        best_bid = sorted_bids
        best_ask = sorted_asks
        
        if best_bid['price'] >= best_ask['price']:
            trade_qty = min(best_bid['qty'], best_ask['qty'])
            execute_trade(best_bid, best_ask, trade_qty)
            
            best_bid['qty'] -= trade_qty
            best_ask['qty'] -= trade_qty
            
            if best_bid['qty'] == 0: sorted_bids.pop(0)
            if best_ask['qty'] == 0: sorted_asks.pop(0)
        else:
            break
```
This implements price-time priority while ensuring atomic order matching[5].

### Message Specification
Messages use **CBOR encoding** for efficiency:
```cbor
{
  "header": {
    "message_id": b64'J9F4J...',
    "timestamp": 1(1687542132),
    "ttl": 30,
    "protocol": "MCP/1.2"
  },
  "body": {
    "type": "BID",
    "port_hash": b64'5T0G8...',
    "compensation_offer": {
      "currency": "ALICE",
      "amount": 20,
      "conditions": ["service_verification"]
    }
  },
  "signatures": [
    {"agent": "Bob", "sig": b64'8G3H1...'},
    {"kernel": "Node7", "sig": b64'K9J2F...'}
  ]
}
```
Critical features include:
- Timestamps using CBOR tag 1 (epoch time)
- Binary payload efficiency
- Embedded cryptographic signatures[2][8][15]

## Conclusion

This architecture establishes a trust framework combining Promise Theory with economic mechanisms. The kernel's infrastructure role enables voluntary cooperation while avoiding obligation assumption, with personal currencies providing quantifiable trust metrics. Cross-machine coordination employs two-phase commit for atomic transactions, while content-addressable message ports enable scalable service discovery. Future work should explore hierarchical hypergraphs for efficient promise dependency analysis and zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving reputation verification[18].
