<think>
We are combining two files: 28810.md and 15110.md into a new file that meets all specified fitness criteria. The fitness criteria emphasize clarity in matching algorithms, kernel-centric messaging, Promise Theory principles, accounting systems, and CBOR formatting.

### Integration Strategy
1. **Structural Synthesis**: 
   - Use 28810.md's clear section organization as the base framework
   - Incorporate 15110.md's detailed technical specifications where deeper explanation is needed
   - Maintain 70-character line wrapping throughout

2. **Promise Theory Implementation**:
   - Strengthen with 15110.md's compensation transformation mechanics
   - Integrate 28810.md's failure consequence differentiation
   - Preserve Burgess' voluntary cooperation framework from both documents

3. **Kernel Role Clarification**:
   - Resolve "trusted counterparty" contradiction by positioning the kernel as settlement facilitator rather than obligation holder
   - Emphasize agent autonomy in line with Promise Theory

4. **Technical Enhancements**:
   - Expand matching algorithm with 15110.md's price-time priority details
   - Augment CBOR section with 15110.md's structure annotations
   - Deepen hypergraph explanation using 15110.md's transactional mappings

5. **Fitness Coverage**:
   - Add explicit Q/A section addressing all three questions
   - Include Mach kernel comparison from both sources
   - Strengthen economic dimensions with compensation premium mechanics

### Document Structure
1. Introduction
2. Kernel Architecture (Trusted Infrastructure)
3. Communication Model
4. Promise Theory Implementation
5. Matching Engine
6. Accounting System
7. Message Format (CBOR)
8. Storage (Hypergraph)
9. Comparison: Mach Kernel
10. Direct Q/A Section

### Conflict Resolution
- **Counterparty Role**: Kernel facilitates settlements but never assumes obligations
- **Network Communication**: Kernel handles routing but allows direct data transfers

# Trusted Kernel Messaging Architecture with Promise-Based Coordination

## Core Architecture Principles

The system implements a **kernel-centric message-passing architecture** where 
every agent interaction constitutes a function call to the kernel[3][4][9]. 
This design eliminates "kernel-mediated channels" in favor of direct 
message-passing analogous to the Mach microkernel's IPC model[1][5]. The kernel 
operates as trusted infrastructure providing:
- **Process Orchestration**: Starts and monitors agent processes
- **Cryptographic Attestation**: Verifies message integrity
- **State Synchronization**: Maintains global consistency
- **Resource Guarantees**: Enforces fair scheduling[2][6][8]
As voluntary cooperation enabler, the kernel facilitates but never participates 
in economic exchanges, preserving agent autonomy through cryptographic 
verification rather than trusted authority[5][7][10].

## Communication Model

### Agent-Kernel Exclusivity
All interactions follow strict **kernel-mediated messaging**:
```plaintext
Agent A → Kernel: Service Request
Kernel → Agent B: Request Forwarding
Agent B → Kernel: Promise Response
Kernel → Agent A: Response Delivery
```
This answers critical design questions:
- **Agent Communication**: Agents interact exclusively through kernel-managed 
  messaging[3][5]
- **Network Handling**: Kernel handles routing/discovery while permitting direct 
  data transfers post-handshake[4][13]
- **Signing Requirements**: Local messages require agent signatures; networked 
  messages add kernel routing signatures[5][8][20]

## Promise Theory Implementation

### Core Tenets
The architecture strictly separates:
- **Requests**: Non-binding impositions attempting influence
- **Promises**: Voluntary commitments about future behavior[7][11][16]
BID-type messages contain compensation offers that transform into binding 
promises only upon explicit acceptance:
```
+------------------+------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Message Type     | Primary Nature         | Binding Transformation        |
+------------------+------------------------+-------------------------------+
| BID Request      | Non-binding imposition | Upon counterparty acceptance   |
| Compensation     | Value-transfer promise | Execution upon fulfillment    |
+------------------+------------------------+-------------------------------+
```
This preserves Burgess' voluntary cooperation principle: agents freely accept or 
reject requests without commitment[10][12][16].

### Economic Dimensions
Compensation functions as **quantifiable trust representation** through:
- Market-driven pricing based on historical fulfillment rates
- Reputation-based premium calculation
- Exchange rates reflecting trust metrics[15][31][38]
This implements voluntary cooperation where exchange rates function as trust 
thermometers—reliable agents command currency premiums proportional to 
verifiable history[2][10][31].

### Failure Differentiation
The system enforces consequence asymmetry:
- **Broken Promises**: Trigger reputation penalties and compensation forfeiture
- **Rejected Requests**: Incur only transaction abandonment
- **Unfulfilled Requests**: Affect credibility but lack contractual consequences[5][8][13]
This models real-world trust dynamics where commitments carry greater weight 
than negotiation attempts.

## Matching Engine Algorithm

The kernel implements transparent **price-time priority matching**:
```
1. Receive BID/ASK messages
2. Validate signatures and account status
3. Sort orders:
   - BID: Descending price (highest first)
   - ASK: Ascending price (lowest first)
4. Match when:
   - BID.price >= ASK.price
   - Quantity > 0
5. Execute sequentially:
   a. Lock compensation in escrow
   b. Transfer service obligations
   c. Atomically settle upon completion
6. Update ledger entries[21][26][34]
```
This simple algorithm prioritizes fairness while enabling verifiable execution 
through cryptographic receipts.

## Double-Entry Promise Accounting

Promises are tracked as personal currencies using balanced accounting:
```
+------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Transaction            | Debit                 | Credit                |
+------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Promise Made (Service) | Service Receivable    | Commitment Liability  |
| Promise Kept           | Commitment Liability  | Service Revenue       |
| Promise Broken         | Reputation Reserve    | Service Receivable    |
+------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
```
Promise make/break events directly map to currency operations, establishing 
promise-currency equivalence[37][39][40]. Each agent maintains their own 
cryptographic ledger with kernel-provided cross-ledger synchronization[31][40].

## Message Specification

### CBOR Encoding
Messages use Concise Binary Object Representation:
```cbor
{
  1: "msg_0425",             // Message ID
  2: {                        // Payload
    1: {                      // Request
      1: "compute_result"     // Action
    },
    2: {                      // Offer
      1: {                    // Compensation
        1: 1500               // Amount
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Critical features include:
- Semantic segregation of request/promise elements
- Dedicated compensation field for standalone tracking
- Conditional binding through signature escalation[17][19][33]

### Hypergraph Storage
Messages persist in hypergraph structures where:
- Nodes represent agents, messages, commitments
- Hyperedges model multi-party relationships
- Content addressing enables tamper-evident retrieval[18][32]
This supports complex promise network analysis while maintaining cryptographic 
integrity.

## Mach Kernel Similarities

The message-passing design shares key characteristics:
1. **Syscall Analogy**: Agent requests mirror userspace-kernel syscalls
2. **Capability Security**: Messages reference explicitly granted rights
3. **Port Abstraction**: Endpoints replace Mach ports
4. **Minimal Kernel**: Core functions limited to routing and control[1][5][9]
Added economic dimensions include compensatable promises and cryptographic 
settlement.

## Direct Questions Addressed

### "Do agents only talk to the kernel?"
Yes. Agents communicate exclusively through kernel-managed messaging channels 
with no direct peer connections. The kernel provides process isolation and 
mandatory security enforcement[3][5][13].

### "Does the kernel handle all network communication?"
The kernel manages all *control plane* operations (routing, discovery, 
handshakes) while permitting *data plane* transfers between authenticated peers. 
This balances security with performance efficiency[4][8][13].

### "Message signing requirements?"
- **Agent→Kernel**: Mandatory agent signatures
- **Kernel→Agent**: Optional kernel attestations
- **Networked**: Kernel routing signatures added
- **Economic commitments**: Non-repudiable agent signatures[5][8][20]
