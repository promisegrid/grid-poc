# Distributed Agent Coordination System

This architecture enables autonomous agents to coordinate through kernel-mediated 
message passing, implementing Promise Theory principles within an economic trust 
framework. Agents interact exclusively with their local kernel, which functions 
as universal counterparty and trusted third party.

## Core Architectural Principles

### Kernel as Trusted Mediator
The kernel provides:
- **Universal Counterparty Service**: Assumes position in every transaction
- **Communication Brokerage**: Routes all inter-agent messages
- **Resource Arbitration**: Starts agents and allocates computational resources
- **Atomic Settlement**: Guarantees transaction completion

Agents function strictly as kernel clients, communicating exclusively through 
kernel-mediated message passing[1][5][13]. This design ensures agents maintain 
no awareness of peer location or infrastructure details.

## Mach-Style Message Passing

### Port Abstraction
ASK orders function as Mach-style ports:
- **Port Creation**: ASK publication establishes receiving endpoint
- **Message Delivery**: BID orders target specific port hashes
- **Connection Semantics**: Matching establishes communication channels

Hashes enable global addressing:
```
ASK_Hash = SHA3(ServiceID + Arguments + Nonce)
BID contains target ASK hash
```
This allows cross-machine matching without central coordination[1][6].

### Function Call Semantics
Every message constitutes a kernel request:
- **Request Structure**: {Function, Arguments, Nonce}
- **Kernel Processing**: Validation → Routing → Execution
- **Response Handling**: Signed result delivery

## Promise Theory Implementation

### Fundamental Distinctions
The system maintains strict separation between:
- **Requests**: Non-binding impositions attempting to influence others
- **Promises**: Voluntary commitments about future behavior

### Bid Semantic Analysis
BID-type messages contain:
1. **Service Request**: Attempt to influence provider behavior
2. **Compensation Promise**: Binding commitment upon acceptance

### Transformation Mechanics
Requests become promises through explicit consent:
1. **Matching Event**: Mutual agreement converts proposals
2. **Escrow Activation**: Collateral deposit verification
3. **Condition Satisfaction**: Predefined criteria fulfillment

### Assessment Framework
The kernel tracks:
- Promise fulfillment rates
- Compensation timeliness
- Service quality metrics
Data feeds into personal currency valuation[3][8][14].

## Economic Trust Building

### Currency Mechanism
Personal currencies quantify trust through:
```
Trust Metric        | Currency Impact
-------------------------------------
Promise fulfillment | Exchange rate appreciation
Service quality     | Transaction volume increase
Compensation speed  | Market depth improvement
```

### Reputation Propagation
- Kernel publishes anonymized fulfillment statistics
- Agents incorporate third-party data into valuation models
- Direct interaction history receives maximum weighting[4][10]

## Matching Engine Operation

### Core Algorithm
```
1. Order intake (BID/ASK messages)
2. Signature validation
3. Order book insertion:
   - BIDS: Descending price → ascending time
   - ASKS: Ascending price → ascending time
4. Matching trigger: BID.price ≥ ASK.price
5. Execution: Earliest compatible orders first
6. Escrow activation:
   - Kernel locks compensation
   - Service obligation transferred
7. Settlement:
   - Service delivery verification
   - Compensation release
   - Ledger update
```

### Distributed Matching
Cross-machine transactions use two-phase commit:
```
Phase 1: Resource verification (Prepare)
Phase 2: Atomic ledger update (Commit)
```
Transaction recorded as hypergraph edge[7][19].

## Inter-Node Communication

### Kernel Coordination Protocol
1. **Discovery**: Kernel broadcasts ASK hashes
2. **Proposal**: Peer kernel submits signed match commitment
3. **Consensus**: Synchronized through:
   - Proof-of-stake validation
   - Byzantine fault tolerance
4. **Escrow Handling**: Multi-signature release conditions

### Trust Establishment
Agents build trust through:
1. **Direct Interaction History**: Personal transaction record
2. **Market Reputation**: Currency exchange rate fluctuations
3. **Third-party Attestations**: Kernel-verified testimonials

## Data Representation

### CBOR Message Format
Messages use Concise Binary Object Representation:
```cbor
{
  1: "msg_0425",          // Content hash
  2: "ASK",                // Message type
  3: {                     // Body
    1: "service_S",        // Service description
    2: 20,                 // Compensation amount
    3: "ALICECOIN"         // Currency specification
  },
  4: "sig_a9b3c"          // Signature
```
Supports efficient parsing of conditional promises[2][15].

### Hypergraph Storage
Messages persist in hypergraph structures:
- **Nodes**: Agents, services, currencies
- **Hyperedges**: Connect transaction participants
- **Content Addressing**: Tamper-evident retrieval[7][11]

## Security Implementation

### Signing Requirements
- **Agent→Kernel**: Signed with agent's private key
- **Kernel→Kernel**: Signed with kernel's private key
- **Ledger Entries**: Kernel-signed for non-repudiation

### Verification Process
1. SHA-3 digest computation
2. Encryption with sender's private key
3. Recipient decryption with sender's public key
4. Digest comparison[5][12]

## Conclusion

This system enables decentralized cooperation through kernel-mediated message 
passing with Promise Theory economics. The matching engine implementation 
provides efficient order coordination while the distributed hypergraph ledger 
ensures tamper-evident transaction recording. Personal currencies create 
quantifiable trust metrics that align individual behavior with system-wide 
cooperation incentives.
