# Kernel-Mediated Agent Communication System

This architecture implements a distributed system where autonomous agents interact exclusively through kernel-mediated message passing, adopting design principles from Mach's IPC model. Agents function as kernel clients, communicating solely with their local kernel instance which serves as universal counterparty and trusted third party. The system implements Promise Theory where requests represent impositions attempting to influence others while promises constitute voluntary commitments about future behavior.

## Core Architectural Principles

### Kernel as Central Mediator
The kernel executes critical functions:
- **Universal Counterparty**: Assumes contractual position in every transaction, guaranteeing settlement regardless of peer status.
- **Resource Allocator**: Regulates computational resources through economic prioritization - agents with higher promise fulfillment rates receive priority processing.
- **Communication Hub**: Exclusively handles network traffic - agents communicate only with their local kernel, which routes messages to peer kernels when necessary[1][5][11].

This design ensures agents maintain no direct knowledge of peers - all interaction occurs through kernel message passing. When Agent Alice requires service from Agent Bob:
1. Alice → Kernel_A: Signs service request
2. Kernel_A → Kernel_B: Forwards with kernel signature
3. Kernel_B → Bob: Delivers after verification
This layered approach abstracts network complexities while providing security through kernel validation[1][3].

## Promise Theory Implementation

The system rigorously applies Promise Theory:

### Request-Promise Transformation
- **BID/ASK orders**: Represent impositions attempting to influence market behavior.
- **Matching event**: Converts requests into binding unilateral promises through voluntary acceptance.

### Voluntary Cooperation
- Agents freely submit/cancel unmatched orders without commitment.
- Kernel cannot compel promise acceptance, preserving agent autonomy.

### Economic Dimensions
- Compensation terms become value-transfer promises upon matching.
- Service descriptions become performance commitments.

### Assessment Mechanisms
- Kernel tracks:
  - Promise fulfillment rates
  - Payment timeliness
  - Service quality metrics
- Data feeds currency valuation algorithms[3][13].

### Failure Differentiation
- **Broken promises**: Recorded in ledger, trigger currency devaluation.
- **Rejected requests**: No ledger impact beyond opportunity cost.

This framework enforces commitments only through voluntary matching[18].

## Economic Trust Building

Personal currencies quantify trust through dynamic mechanisms:

1. **Currency Valuation**: Exchange rates adjust based on promise fulfillment rates - agents maintaining >95% fulfillment enjoy strongest currencies.

2. **Trust Propagation**: Kernel publishes anonymized fulfillment statistics enabling agents to incorporate third-party data into valuation models.

3. **Consequence Framework**: Chronic promise-breakers face currency devaluation while high-trust agents receive resource priority[4][12].

## Matching Engine Operation

### Local Matching Algorithm
The kernel employs price-time priority:
```
1. Order intake: Signed BID/ASK messages arrive
2. Validation: Verify signatures and account balances
3. Order book insertion:
   - BIDS: Descending price then ascending time
   - ASKS: Ascending price then ascending time
4. Matching: Triggered when BID.price >= ASK.price
   - Execute at asker's price
   - Prioritize earliest compatible orders
5. Escrow activation: Lock compensation in kernel accounts
6. Settlement: Transfer after promise fulfillment
```
This O(1) complexity process ensures deterministic execution[6][17].

### Distributed Matching Protocol
For cross-machine transactions:
1. **Discovery**: Kernel_A broadcasts ASK hashes to peers
2. **Locking**: Kernel_B proposes signed match commitment
3. **Two-Phase Commit**:
   - Prepare: Kernels verify resource availability
   - Commit: Atomic ledger update across nodes
4. **Hypergraph Recording**: Transaction stored as hyperedge connecting participants[7][16]

## Message Structure and Security

### CBOR Format
Messages use Concise Binary Object Representation:
```cbor
{
  1: "msg_0815",            // Content hash
  2: "BID",                 // Order type
  3: {                       // Body
    1: "service_S",          // Service
    2: 20,                   // Amount
    3: "ALICECOIN"           // Currency
  },
  4: "sig_k720f"            // Signature
}
```
CBOR enables efficient parsing while supporting complex conditional structures[2][9].

### Signing Requirements
- **Agent→Kernel**: Signed with agent's private key
- **Kernel→Kernel**: Signed with kernel's private key
- Storage: Kernel signs ledger entries

Verification process:
1. SHA-3 digest computed
2. Encrypted with sender's private key
3. Recipient decrypts with sender's public key
4. Compares to freshly computed digest[5][19].

## Data Architecture

### Double-Entry Accounting
Each message corresponds to balanced transaction:
- **ASK Creation**:
  ```plaintext
  DR Alice:ServiceReceivable    20 ALICECOIN
  CR Alice:PromiseLiability     20 ALICECOIN
  ```
- **BID Acceptance**:
  ```plaintext
  DR Bob:PromiseAsset           20 ALICECOIN
  CR Bob:CompensationPayable    20 ALICECOIN
  ```
Promise make/break events directly map to currency operations[4][14].

### Hypergraph Storage
Messages persist in hypergraph structures where:
- Vertices represent agents, promises, events
- Hyperedges connect commitment participants
- Merkle links ensure tamper evidence[7][11]

This enables complex relationship modeling while maintaining cryptographic integrity[10].

## Conclusion

This architecture enables decentralized cooperation through kernel-mediated message passing with Mach-inspired IPC semantics. Promise Theory principles manifest through economic mechanisms where kept promises strengthen personal currencies and broken promises incur tangible costs. The hypergraph-based storage and CBOR message format ensure efficient handling of complex relationships while maintaining verifiable integrity across distributed systems.
