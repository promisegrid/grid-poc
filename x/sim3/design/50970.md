# Kernel-Mediated Agent Coordination System with Promise-Based Economics

This document presents a comprehensive architecture for autonomous agent coordination centered on kernel-mediated message passing and Promise Theory principles. The system enables decentralized cooperation through economic mechanisms where agents issue conditional promises encoded as CBOR-formatted messages stored in hypergraph structures. The kernel functions as universal counterparty and trusted third party while enforcing double-entry accounting of personal currencies that quantify trustworthiness. Communication follows Mach-inspired IPC semantics with ASK orders serving as port-like endpoints and BID orders functioning as targeted messages. Distributed coordination resolves through two-phase commit protocols ensuring atomic promise fulfillment across network boundaries.

## System Architecture and Core Principles

The architecture establishes strict boundaries where agents interact exclusively with their local kernel instance, never directly with peers. Each kernel functions as universal counterparty—assuming contractual responsibility for all transactions—and trusted third party enforcing promise execution. Agents initiate as unprivileged child processes of the kernel, possessing no independent networking capabilities. All inter-agent communication transits kernel-managed channels with local messages requiring agent signatures and network messages requiring kernel signatures[1][5][7].

Communication implements Mach-derived semantics where ASK orders create port-like service endpoints identified by cryptographic hashes, while BID orders function as messages targeted to specific ASK hashes. This abstraction enables location-transparent interaction—agents reference service endpoints by content hash rather than physical address. Kernels maintain distributed "plugboards" of remote ASK ports discovered through periodic hash announcements, enabling efficient cross-machine matching without centralized coordination[1][5][11].

## Communication Model Implementation

### Local Interaction Protocol
When co-resident agents interact:
1. Alice's kernel publishes hashed ASK order to local registry
2. Bob's kernel submits signed BID to local port identified by ASK hash
3. Matching engine verifies compatibility and initiates escrow
4. Alice performs service, kernel updates ledgers atomically[4][9]

### Distributed Coordination
For cross-machine transactions:
1. Kernel_A broadcasts ASK hashes to known peers
2. Kernel_B identifies matching BID for remote ASK
3. Kernels initiate two-phase commit:
   - **Prepare**: Verify resource availability
   - **Commit**: Atomically update ledgers
4. Service execution with kernel-mediated result transfer[6][14]

This protocol resolves the "K_Bob does what" problem through atomic commitment avoiding distributed locking. Cryptographic non-repudiation prevents repudiation while economic penalties enforce promise execution[6][14].

## Trust Development Mechanism

Trust emerges through ledger-visible promise fulfillment histories quantified in personal currency valuations. The kernel maintains double-entry accounts where:
- Kept promises: Increase currency demand → appreciation
- Broken promises: Trigger penalty debits → depreciation
- Rejected requests: No ledger impact[3][10][12]

Agents access anonymized fulfillment statistics to inform counterparty risk assessments. High-trust agents receive resource priority through kernel's "buy low/sell high" resource allocation—reliable promise-keepers access computational resources at preferential rates[3][12].

## Matching Engine Operation

The kernel implements price-time priority matching:
```
FUNCTION match_orders(order_book):
  WHILE best_bid.price >= best_ask.price:
      match = EXTRACT top bid-ask pair
      execution_price = best_ask.price
      ESCROW transfer to kernel custody
      GENERATE promise contracts
      APPEND to fulfillment queue
  RETURN execution_receipts
```
Cross-machine matches invoke two-phase commit where kernels:
1. Exchange signed match proposals
2. Verify resource availability
3. Atomically update ledgers
4. Create Merkle-linked hypergraph records[4][9][19]

## Promise Theory Implementation

The system enforces core Promise Theory tenets:

### Request-Promise Distinction
- **BID/ASK orders**: Represent impositions influencing market behavior
- **Matched orders**: Transform into binding unilateral promises

### Voluntary Cooperation
- Agents freely submit/cancel unmatched orders
- Kernel never compels promise acceptance

### Economic Dimensions
- Compensation terms become value-transfer promises upon matching
- Service descriptions become performance commitments

### Failure Differentiation
- **Broken promises**: Recorded in ledger → currency devaluation
- **Rejected requests**: No ledger impact
- **Unfulfilled requests**: Credibility impact[2][8][13]

## Data Representation Standards

### CBOR Message Structure
Messages use Concise Binary Object Representation:
```cbor
{
  1: "msg_0815",            // Content hash
  2: "BID",                 // Message type
  3: {                       // Body
    1: "service_S",          // Service identifier
    2: 20,                   // Compensation amount
    3: "ALICECOIN",          // Currency
    4: "exp_20300101"        // Expiration
  },
  4: "sig_k720f"            // Ed25519 signature
}
```
This enables efficient parsing while supporting complex conditional structures[3][16][18].

### Hypergraph Storage
All messages persist in hypergraph structures where:
- Vertices represent agents, promises, outcomes
- Hyperedges connect commitment participants
- Cryptographic links ensure tamper evidence[7][19]

### Double-Entry Implementation
Each message corresponds to balanced transaction:
```plaintext
ASK Creation:
  DR Alice:ServiceReceivable    20 ALICECOIN
  CR Alice:PromiseLiability     20 ALICECOIN

Promise Fulfillment:
  DR Alice:PromiseLiability     20 ALICECOIN
  CR Alice:CurrencySupply       20 ALICECOIN
```
Promise make/break events directly map to currency operations[4][12][14].

## Conclusion

This architecture enables verifiable decentralized cooperation through cryptographically enforced economic accountability. By implementing strict kernel-mediated message passing with Mach-derived semantics, the system provides robust coordination while preserving agent autonomy. Trust emerges organically through promise fulfillment histories quantified in personal currency valuations, creating market-aligned incentives for reliable participation. Future work includes formal verification of protocol security properties and benchmarking hypergraph scaling characteristics.
