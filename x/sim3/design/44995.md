# Distributed Agent Coordination Through Promise-Based Economics

This architecture establishes a kernel-mediated coordination system where agents interact exclusively through message passing. The kernel functions as trusted infrastructure providing communication routing, transaction settlement, and trust metric computation while explicitly avoiding obligation assumption. Agents maintain autonomy through voluntary commitments while benefiting from kernel-provided security and coordination services[1][5][7].

## Kernel Architecture

### Foundational Roles
The kernel serves three primary functions:
1. **Trusted Third Party**: Provides cryptographic verification of agent identities and message integrity without participating in economic exchanges
2. **System Orchestrator**: Starts agents and manages computational resources
3. **Communication Mediator**: Handles all message routing between agents using Mach-inspired port-based addressing[1][5][7]

Agents interact strictly as clients to kernel services, maintaining no direct awareness of peer implementation details. This design answers critical questions:
- **Agent Communication**: Agents communicate exclusively through kernel interfaces
- **Network Handling**: Kernel manages routing/discovery but doesn't monopolize data transit
- **Agent Relationships**: Agents know only the kernel's interfaces, not peer specifics[1][5][7]

## Communication Model

### Message Passing Architecture
All interactions follow a strict request/response pattern:
```
Agent → Kernel: Signed message (CBOR-encoded)
Kernel → Peer Kernel: Routed with kernel attestation
Peer Kernel → Target Agent: Delivers verified payload
```
This implements:
- **Function Call Semantics**: Messages represent kernel-mediated operations
- **Encapsulated Networking**: Kernel handles transport abstraction
- **Security Inheritance**: Kernel attestation extends trust between nodes[4][6][8]

### Signing Requirements
The security model employs layered verification:
- **Local Messages**: Require agent signatures only
- **Network Messages**: Add kernel routing signatures
- **Critical Operations**: Require multi-signature validation
This balances security with performance while preserving non-repudiation[4][8].

## Promise Theory Implementation

### Ontological Distinction
The system enforces strict separation between:
- **Requests**: Non-binding impositions attempting influence
- **Promises**: Voluntary commitments about future behavior

BID-type messages contain compensation offers that transform into binding promises only upon explicit acceptance, preserving the core principle that requests never constitute obligations[9][10][11].

### Transformation Mechanics
Requests acquire binding properties exclusively through:
1. **Matching Event**: Mutual agreement converts proposals to commitments
2. **Escrow Activation**: Compensation lock creates binding obligation
3. **Service Execution**: Performance obligation begins
This maintains voluntary cooperation while enabling economically binding agreements[9][10].

### Assessment Mechanisms
The system tracks:
- Promise fulfillment rates
- Compensation transfer timeliness
- Service quality metrics
Agents use this data to adjust currency exchange rates, creating market-driven trust metrics[10][12].

## Economic System

### Currency Mechanics
Personal currencies quantify trust through exchange mechanisms:
```
+----------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------+
| Trust Metric         | Currency Impact         | Measurement Period    |
+----------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------+
| Promise fulfillment  | Exchange rate premium   | Rolling 90-day window|
| Service quality      | Transaction volume      | Per-service basis     |
| Compensation speed   | Market depth improvement| Per-transaction basis |
+----------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------+
```
This implements Burgess' voluntary cooperation through economic incentives while maintaining promise/request ontological separation[10][12].

## Matching Engine

### Algorithm Implementation
The kernel employs price-time priority matching:
```
1. Receive signed BID/ASK messages
2. Validate signatures and ledger balances
3. Sort orders by:
   - Price (BID descending, ASK ascending)
   - Timestamp (earlier orders prioritized)
4. Match when BID.price >= ASK.price
5. Execute sequentially through:
   a. Compensation escrow lock
   b. Service obligation transfer
   c. Atomic settlement upon verification
```
This provides deterministic execution while preventing front-running[2][13].

### Distributed Coordination
For cross-node matches (Option C):
1. K_Alice publishes ASK order
2. K_Bob detects matching BID
3. Initiate Two-Phase Commit:
   - Prepare Phase: Resource verification
   - Commit Phase: Atomic ledger update
4. Hypergraph records transaction
This solves the coordination problem without centralized locking[2][6][13].

## Data Representation

### CBOR Message Format
Messages use Concise Binary Object Representation:
```cbor
{
  1: "msg_0425",          // Content hash
  2: "ASK",                // Message type
  3: {                     // Body
    1: "DataAnalysis",     // Service description
    2: 150,                // Compensation amount
    3: "ALICECOIN",        // Currency
    4: ["JSON", "CSV"]     // Output formats
  }
}
```
Each message constitutes:
- **Conditional Promise**: Commitments contingent on acceptance
- **Balanced Transaction**: Double-entry accounting primitive
- **Hypergraph Component**: Stored as verifiable edge[3][14][15]

### Hypergraph Storage
The ledger implements:
- Nodes for agents, messages, currencies
- Hyperedges connecting transaction participants
- Content addressing for integrity verification
This enables efficient promise network traversal and dependency analysis[14][15].

## Mach Kernel Similarities

The design adopts microkernel principles:
1. **Port Abstraction**: ASK orders function as Mach-style ports
   - Port creation: `listening_port = kernel.create_ask(...)`
   - Message sending: `kernel.send_bid(target_port, ...)`
2. **Capability Security**: Port rights control access
3. **Message Passing**: Fundamental communication primitive[1][5][7]
BID orders function as messages sent to specific ports, enabling distributed matching without coordination locks[1][5][7].

## Conclusion

This architecture enables trustless cooperation through cryptographic verification and promise-based economics. The kernel's infrastructure role provides essential services without becoming an economic participant, while two-phase commit coordination enables distributed matching. By maintaining the critical distinction between impositions and promises while implementing contextual binding through verifiable mechanisms, the system enables voluntary cooperation at scale.
