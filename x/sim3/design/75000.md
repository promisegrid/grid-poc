# Distributed Agent Coordination System

This document details an architecture enabling autonomous agents to
coordinate through kernel-mediated message passing, implementing Promise
Theory principles within an economic trust framework. Agents interact
exclusively with their local kernel, which functions as universal
counterparty and trusted third party.

## Kernel Architecture

### Central Coordination Mechanism
The kernel serves three critical functions: (1) Universal counterparty
service assuming position in every transaction (2) Exclusive
communication brokerage routing all inter-agent messages (3) Resource
arbitration starting agents and allocating computational resources. This
design enforces agent ignorance of peer location or infrastructure
details[1][5].

### Network Abstraction
Agents function strictly as kernel clients without awareness of physical
network topology. All communication occurs through kernel-mediated
message passing, with the kernel handling: (1) Message signing (2)
Routing (3) Delivery verification. Network hops require kernel-to-kernel
communication with locally resigned messages[1][13].

## Promise Theory Implementation

### Fundamental Distinctions
The system rigorously maintains the critical Promise Theory separation
between: (1) **Requests**: Non-binding impositions attempting to
influence others (BID-type messages) (2) **Promises**: Voluntary
commitments about future behavior. This distinction preserves agent
autonomy while enabling cooperation[3][5][14].

### Bid Semantic Analysis
BID messages contain embedded compensation offers that remain optional
requests until explicit acceptance by ASK providers. The compensation
component transforms into binding promissory commitment exclusively
through provider acceptance, maintaining the essential separation between
influence attempts and voluntary commitments[3][14].

### Conditional Transformation
Requests acquire binding properties only through: (1) Explicit match
acceptance (2) Escrow collateralization (3) Multisignature agreement.
These transformations occur without creating prior obligations, preserving
the voluntary nature of the system[3][8][14].

### Assessment Mechanisms
The kernel tracks: (1) Promise fulfillment rates (2) Compensation
timeliness (3) Service quality metrics. This data feeds reputation
algorithms that influence currency valuation through market mechanisms.
Broken promises trigger reputation reserve debits while rejected
requests incur no ledger impact[3][5][14].

## Economic Trust Building

### Currency Mechanism
Personal currencies quantify trust through: (1) Exchange rates
reflecting promise fulfillment likelihood (2) Transaction volume
indicating service adoption (3) Market depth showing liquidity
confidence. Kernel-published statistics propagate reputation data while
preserving counterparty anonymity until transaction commitment[5][8].

## Matching Engine Operation

### Core Algorithm
The kernel-local matching engine implements deterministic price-time
priority: (1) Order intake (2) Signature validation (3) Order book
insertion (BIDS: price descending, time ascending; ASKS: price
ascending, time ascending) (4) Matching trigger (BID.price ≥ ASK.price)
(5) Execution of earliest compatible orders (6) Escrow activation (7)
Settlement through service verification and compensation release[7][18].

### Distributed Coordination
Cross-machine transactions use two-phase commit: (1) **Prepare phase**:
Resource verification across nodes (2) **Commit phase**: Atomic ledger
update. This protocol solves the K_Bob coordination problem by ensuring
all participating kernels either commit to the transaction or roll back
state changes[13][16][17]. ASK orders publish as Mach-style ports via
content-addressed hashes while BID orders target these hashes across
nodes[1][6][11].

## Mach Kernel Similarities

### Port Abstraction
ASK orders function as Mach-style ports: (1) Port creation through ASK
publication (2) Global addressing via content hashing (3) Message
delivery through BID targeting (4) Connection semantics through matching
events. This design enables cross-machine communication without
centralized coordination[1][4][6].

### Minimalist Protocol
Similar to Mach microkernel principles: (1) Restricted kernel functions
(routing, escrow, ledger) (2) Capability-based security where messages
reference explicitly granted rights (3) Port-based addressing replacing
physical network details[1][4][6].

## Data Representation

### CBOR Message Format
Messages use Concise Binary Object Representation:
```cbor
{
  1: "msg_0425",          // Content hash
  2: "ASK",                // Message type
  3: {                     // Body
    1: "service_S",        // Service description
    2: 20,                 // Compensation amount
    3: "ALICECOIN"         // Currency specification
  },
  4: "sig_a9b3c"          // Signature
```
Providing efficient parsing while supporting conditional promise
structures[2][15][16].

### Hypergraph Storage
Messages persist in hypergraph structures where: (1) Nodes represent
agents, services, currencies (2) Hyperedges connect transaction
participants (3) Content addressing enables tamper-evident retrieval.
Each message constitutes a balanced double-entry accounting transaction
recording service obligation and compensation commitment[19][20].

## Accounting System

### Double-Entry Implementation
All economic events maintain strict accounting equivalency:
```
Promise Creation:
  Debit:  Receivable::Service
  Credit: Liability::Commitment

Promise Fulfillment:
  Debit:  Liability::Commitment
  Credit: Revenue::Service

Promise Breach:
  Debit:  Expense::Reputation
  Credit: Receivable::Service
```
Maintaining verifiable transaction integrity[3][12].

## Security Implementation

### Signing Requirements
- **Agent→Kernel**: Signed with agent's private key
- **Kernel→Kernel**: Signed with kernel's private key
- **Ledger Entries**: Kernel-signed for non-repudiation

### Verification Process
The kernel implements: (1) SHA-3 digest computation (2) Encryption with
sender's private key (3) Recipient decryption with sender's public key
(4) Digest comparison. This prevents spoofing while maintaining
non-repudiation[1][5][9].

## Kernel Economic Regulation

### Resource Allocation
The kernel regulates computational access through: (1) Transaction fee
structures influencing order flow (2) Priority scheduling based on
currency valuation (3) Resource reservation escrows. This creates
economic incentives aligning individual behavior with system health[8][14]
.

## Conclusion

This architecture establishes trust-based cooperation through kernel-
mediated message passing while preserving Promise Theory's core
principles. The distributed coordination protocol solves cross-node
matching through content-addressed ASK ports and two-phase commitment.
Personal currencies create measurable trust metrics that align individual
behavior with system-wide cooperation incentives.
