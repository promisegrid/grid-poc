# Distributed Agent System Architecture

This document details a kernel-mediated architecture where autonomous agents interact exclusively through message passing. The system employs Promise Theory principles to distinguish requests as impositions from promises as voluntary commitments. All communication occurs through a trusted kernel that serves as counterparty for all trades, maintains hypergraph-structured ledgers using double-entry accounting, and implements Mach-inspired message passing with CBOR-encoded messages. The design enables decentralized trust building through personal currency valuation tied to promise fulfillment rates.

## Kernel-Agent Interaction Model

The kernel functions as central message router and trusted third party for all transactions. Agents exclusively communicate with their local kernel instance via function call-style messages. Each message contains:

1. **Function Identifier**: Specifies requested kernel action  
2. **Parameters**: Input data for function execution  
3. **Conditional Promises**: Commitment terms for future behavior  
4. **Accounting Entries**: Balanced debit/credit transactions  

Messages use CBOR encoding with type tags indicating function categories[13][17]. The kernel processes messages through four phases: cryptographic verification, promise validation, accounting integrity checks, and execution scheduling. Agents have no direct awareness of other agents - all inter-agent communication is kernel-mediated through port-like message queues[1][6][7].

## Promise Theory Implementation

The system rigorously applies Promise Theory principles:

### Request-Promise Distinction
- **BID/ASK orders**: Represent impositions attempting to influence the market  
- **Matched orders**: Become binding unilateral promises about future behavior  

### Voluntary Cooperation
- Unmatched orders can be freely canceled without penalty  
- Kernel cannot compel promise acceptance  

### Embedded Commitments
- Compensation terms (e.g., "Pay 20 X-coins") transform into value-transfer promises upon matching  
- Service descriptions become performance promises  

### Assessment Mechanisms
- Promise fulfillment statistics track:  
  - Service completion rates  
  - Payment timeliness  
- Data feeds currency valuation algorithms  

### Failure Differentiation
- **Broken promises**: Recorded in ledger, trigger currency devaluation  
- **Rejected requests**: No accounting impact beyond opportunity cost  

This framework ensures agents retain autonomy while creating binding commitments only through voluntary acceptance[8][14][20].

## Economic Trust Building System

Personal currencies serve as trust quantification mechanisms:

1. **Currency Valuation**:  
   - Exchange rates dynamically adjust based on promise fulfillment rates  
   - Agents with >95% fulfillment maintain strongest currencies  

2. **Trust Propagation**:  
   - Kernel publishes anonymized fulfillment statistics  
   - Agents incorporate third-party data into currency valuation models  

3. **Consequence Framework**:  
   - Chronic promise-breakers face currency devaluation  
   - High-trust agents receive priority in resource allocation  

This creates an incentive structure where reliable promise-keeping directly improves resource access[4][12][15].

## Distributed Matching Protocol

### Local Matching
1. Kernel maintains price-time priority order book  
2. New BID order checks for matching ASK orders:  
   - Exact service/currency match required  
   - Highest priced ASK first (for BID)  
   - Earliest ASK first at equal prices  
3. On match:  
   - Orders convert to binding promises  
   - Kernel creates escrow entries  

### Cross-Machine Matching
1. **Discovery Phase**:  
   - Kernel_A broadcasts ASK order hashes to peers  
   - Kernel_B checks against local BID orders  

2. **Locking Phase**:  
   - Kernel_B sends signed match proposal  
   - Both kernels freeze matched orders  

3. **Commit Phase**:  
   - Kernels exchange two-phase commit certificates  
   - Create cross-kernel escrow entries  
   - Update distributed hypergraph ledger  

The matching algorithm runs in O(1) time for limit order book operations[15][19].

## Message Structure and Security

### CBOR Message Format
Messages use Concise Binary Object Representation:
```
{
  1: "BID_ORDER",           // Major type 1: text string
  2: {                      // Major type 5: map
    "service": "IMAGE_PROC",
    "currency": "BOB_COIN",
    "amount": 30.5          // Major type 7: float
  },
  3: [                      // Major type 4: array
    ["DEBIT", "ESCROW", 30.5],
    ["CREDIT", "KERNEL", 30.5]
  ]
}
```

### Signing Protocol
- **Local messages**: Signed with agent's private key  
- **Inter-kernel messages**: Signed with kernel's private key  
- Verification process:  
  1. SHA-3 digest computed  
  2. Signed with sender's private key  
  3. Recipient verifies with sender's public key  
  4. Digital signature stored in hypergraph ledger  

This ensures non-repudiation and tamper evidence for all transactions[5][11][13].

## Data Architecture

### Hypergraph Ledger
Transactions store in hypergraph structure where:
- Vertices represent: agents, kernels, promises  
- Hyperedges connect: transaction participants  
- Enables efficient:  
  - Promise dependency tracing  
  - Multi-party transaction retrieval  
  - Reputation graph analysis  

### Double-Entry Accounting
Every transaction maintains balance:
```
BID Order Placement:
  Agent:   Currency Asset -X, Kernel Escrow +X
  Kernel:  Currency Liability +X, Agent Escrow -X

Promise Fulfillment:
  Agent:   Service Asset -Y, Currency Receivable +Y
  Client:  Service Liability -Y, Currency Payable +Y
  Kernel:  Settlement Fee +Z
```
Promise make/break events generate equivalent currency transfers[4][10][16].

## Trusted Kernel Functions

The kernel provides three critical services:

1. **Counterparty Role**:  
   - Assumes contractual position in all transactions  
   - Guarantees settlement regardless of agent availability  

2. **Market Regulation**:  
   - Adjusts transaction fees based on system load  
   - Prioritizes resource access by trust metrics  
   - Discourages speculation via order throttling  

3. **Agent Management**:  
   - Starts/stops agent processes  
   - Enforces resource quotas  
   - Maintains isolated execution environments  

This architecture positions the kernel as foundational infrastructure enabling decentralized cooperation[9][18].

## Network Communication Framework

### Message Routing
- Agents submit messages to local kernel  
- Kernel determines destination:  
   - Local agent: Direct message delivery  
   - Remote agent: Forwarded to peer kernel  

### Kernel Coordination
- Distributed hash table tracks agent locations  
- Gossip protocol disseminates service advertisements  
- Signed heartbeat messages maintain peer connectivity  

All network communication occurs between kernels using mutually authenticated channels[2][7].

## Conclusion

This architecture enables decentralized cooperation through three innovations:  
1. Machinery-theoretic message passing providing process isolation  
2. Promise Theory implementation preserving agent autonomy  
3. Economic trust system quantifying reliability  

Future work includes implementing dynamic reputation algorithms and exploring zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving reputation verification. The system demonstrates how distributed systems can achieve cooperation without centralized control through careful application of promise-based interactions.
