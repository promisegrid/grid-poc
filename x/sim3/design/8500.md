# Kernel-Centric Message Passing Architecture with Promise-Based Coordination

## Core Architecture Principles

The system implements a **message-passing architecture** where every inter-node 
communication constitutes a function call to the kernel[1][4][5]. Agents interact 
exclusively through kernel-mediated message passing, analogous to the Mach 
microkernel's IPC model[1][4][7]. The kernel serves as:

1. **Trusted Third Party**: Provides cryptographic attestation and state 
   synchronization
2. **Resource Manager**: Starts agents and allocates computational resources
3. **Market Facilitator**: Operates automated market maker functions
4. **Settlement Enforcer**: Guarantees atomic transaction completion[2][5][14]

Agents function as clients to the kernel server, with all economic exchanges 
occurring bilaterally between agents while the kernel provides settlement 
infrastructure without assuming counterparty risk[5][9][14].

## Communication Model

### Agent-Kernel Exclusivity
All interactions follow the pattern:
```plaintext
Agent → Kernel: Request (e.g., "Deliver message to Agent B")
Kernel → Target Agent: Forwarded request
Agent → Kernel: Response
Kernel → Original Agent: Deliver response
```
This answers critical design questions:
- **Agent Communication Exclusivity**: Agents communicate solely through kernel 
  message passing[3][5][8]
- **Network Handling**: Kernel manages routing/discovery but permits direct data 
  transfers post-handshake[4][8][13]
- **Signing Requirements**: 
  - Local messages: Signed by originating agent
  - Network messages: Additional kernel routing signature[5][8][20]

## Promise Theory Implementation

### Core Tenets
The architecture enforces ontological separation between:
- **Requests**: Non-binding impositions attempting influence
- **Promises**: Voluntary commitments about future behavior[11][15][16]

BID-type messages contain compensation offers that transform into binding 
promises only upon explicit acceptance:
```
+------------------+------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Message Type     | Primary Nature         | Binding Transformation        |
+------------------+------------------------+-------------------------------+
| BID Request      | Non-binding imposition | Upon counterparty acceptance   |
| Compensation     | Value-transfer promise | Execution upon fulfillment    |
+------------------+------------------------+-------------------------------+
```
This preserves Burgess' voluntary cooperation principle: agents freely accept or 
reject requests without prior commitment[10][12][16].

### Failure Differentiation
The system enforces consequence asymmetry:
- **Broken Promises**: Trigger reputation penalties and compensation forfeiture
- **Rejected Requests**: Incur only transaction abandonment
- **Unfulfilled Requests**: Affect credibility but lack contractual consequences[5][8][13]

## Matching Engine Implementation

The kernel employs transparent **price-time priority matching**:
```
1. Collect BID/ASK messages
2. Validate signatures and balances
3. Sort orders:
   - BIDs: Descending price
   - ASKs: Ascending price
4. Match when BID.price >= ASK.price
5. Execute sequentially:
   a. Lock compensation in escrow
   b. Transfer service obligations
   c. Atomically settle upon completion
6. Update ledger entries
```
The kernel regulates resource allocation by:
- Buying services at ASK prices (low)
- Selling services at BID prices (high)
- Profiting from spreads to prioritize high-value interactions[15][16][21]

## Double-Entry Promise Accounting

Promises are tracked as personal currencies using balanced accounting:
```
+------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Transaction            | Debit                 | Credit                |
+------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Promise Made (Service) | Service Receivable    | Commitment Liability  |
| Promise Kept           | Commitment Liability  | Service Revenue       |
| Promise Broken         | Reputation Reserve    | Service Receivable    |
+------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
```
Promise make/break events directly map to currency operations, establishing 
promise-currency equivalence[13][19][20].

## Message Specification

### CBOR Format
Messages use Concise Binary Object Representation:
```cbor
{
  1: "msg_0425",             // Message ID
  2: {                        // Payload
    1: {                      // Request
      1: "compute_result"     // Action
    },
    2: {                      // Offer
      1: {                    // Compensation
        1: 1500               // Amount
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Each message constitutes a **conditional promise** where:
- Service execution is promised upon compensation acceptance
- Compensation transfer is promised upon service verification
- Ledger annotations ensure double-entry balance[17][18][22]

### Hypergraph Storage
Messages persist in hypergraph structures where:
- Nodes represent agents, messages, commitments
- Hyperedges model multi-party relationships
- Content addressing enables tamper-evident retrieval[18][19]

## Mach Kernel Similarities

The architecture shares key characteristics with Mach microkernel:
1. **Syscall Analogy**: Agent requests mirror userspace-kernel syscalls
2. **Capability Security**: Messages reference explicitly granted rights
3. **Port Abstraction**: Virtual endpoints replace physical ports
4. **Minimal Kernel**: Core functions limited to routing and control[1][4][7]

## Direct Questions Answered

### "Do agents know each other?"
Agents interact through cryptographic identifiers without direct awareness. The 
kernel maintains a capability-based access matrix where:
- Agents specify message recipients by public key
- Kernel verifies pairwise authorization
- No global agent directory exists[3][5][8]

### "How do agents build trust?"
Trust emerges through:
1. **Observable Promise Fulfillment**: Public ledger tracks commitment history
2. **Compensation-at-Risk**: Staked currency backing promises
3. **Reputation Premiums**: Higher compensation for reliable agents
4. **Gradual Exposure**: Slowly increasing engagement limits[5][10][14]

### "How does inter-node communication work?"
Communication follows strict kernel mediation:
1. Agent signs request addressed to recipient's public key
2. Kernel verifies signatures and routing permissions
3. Kernel forwards message to recipient's message queue
4. Recipient processes message and submits response
5. Kernel delivers response to original sender[1][4][5]
