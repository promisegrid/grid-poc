# Kernel-Mediated Distributed Agent System with Promise-Based Economics

## Introduction to System Architecture

This architecture implements a distributed system where autonomous agents interact through kernel-mediated message passing, adapting design principles from Mach's IPC model. Agents function exclusively as kernel clients, with all communication flowing through the kernel which serves as both communication broker and universal counterparty. The system operationalizes Promise Theory by distinguishing requests (influence attempts) from promises (voluntary commitments), with economic mechanisms translating trust into currency valuations. Each kernel instance manages a hypergraph-structured ledger implementing double-entry accounting for promise lifecycle tracking[1][5][9][16].

## Kernel as Centralized Mediator

### Role and Responsibilities
The kernel executes three critical functions:
- **Universal Counterparty**: Assumes contractual position in every transaction, guaranteeing settlement regardless of peer status.
- **Resource Allocator**: Regulates computational resources through economic prioritization – agents with higher promise fulfillment rates receive processing priority.
- **Communication Hub**: Exclusively handles all network traffic with agents interacting solely with their local kernel[1][3][12].

This design ensures agents maintain no direct knowledge of peers – all interaction occurs through kernel message passing. When Agent Alice requires service from Agent Bob:
1. Alice → Kernel_A: Signs service request
2. Kernel_A → Kernel_B: Forwards request with kernel attestation
3. Kernel_B → Bob: Delivers request after verification
This layered approach abstracts network complexities while providing security through kernel validation[1][6][23].

## Promise Theory Implementation

The system rigorously applies Promise Theory principles:

### Request-Promise Transformation
- **BID/ASK orders**: Represent non-binding impositions attempting to influence market behavior.
- **Matching event**: Converts requests into binding unilateral promises through voluntary acceptance[4][14][18].

### Voluntary Cooperation Framework
- Agents freely submit/cancel unmatched orders without commitment.
- Kernel cannot compel promise acceptance, preserving agent autonomy[4][14][35].

### Economic Dimensions
- Compensation terms become value-transfer promises upon matching.
- Service descriptions become performance commitments[4][8][14].

### Assessment Mechanisms
- Kernel tracks:
  - Promise fulfillment rates
  - Payment timeliness
  - Service quality metrics
- Data feeds currency valuation algorithms[4][9][15].

### Failure Consequence Differentiation
- **Broken promises**: Recorded in ledger, trigger currency devaluation.
- **Rejected requests**: No ledger impact beyond opportunity cost[4][14][35].

This framework ensures commitments emerge only through voluntary matching rather than coercion[18].

## Economic Trust Building Mechanisms

Personal currencies implement quantifiable trust through:

1. **Currency Valuation Algorithms**: Exchange rates dynamically adjust based on promise fulfillment rates – agents maintaining >95% fulfillment enjoy strongest currencies.

2. **Trust Propagation**: Kernel publishes anonymized fulfillment statistics enabling agents to incorporate third-party data into valuation models.

3. **Consequence Framework**: Chronic promise-breakers face currency devaluation while high-trust agents receive resource priority[4][9][15].

## Matching Engine Implementation

### Local Matching Protocol
The kernel employs price-time priority:
```
1. Order intake: Signed BID/ASK messages arrive
2. Validation: Verify signatures and account balances
3. Order book insertion:
   - BIDS: Descending price → ascending time
   - ASKS: Ascending price → ascending time
4. Matching: Triggered when BID.price ≥ ASK.price
   - Execute at asker's price
   - Prioritize earliest compatible orders
5. Escrow activation: Lock compensation in kernel accounts
6. Settlement: Transfer after promise fulfillment
```
This O(1) complexity process ensures deterministic execution[17][18][22].

### Distributed Matching Protocol
For cross-machine transactions:
1. **Discovery**: Kernel_A broadcasts ASK hashes to peers
2. **Locking**: Kernel_B proposes signed match commitment
3. **Two-Phase Commit**:
   - Prepare: Kernels verify resource availability
   - Commit: Atomic ledger update across nodes
4. **Hypergraph Recording**: Transaction stored as hyperedge connecting participants[7][13][16][23]

## Message Structure and Security

### CBOR Encoding
Messages use Concise Binary Object Representation:
```cbor
{
  1: "msg_0815",            // Content hash
  2: "BID",                 // Order type
  3: {                       // Body
    1: "service_S",          // Service
    2: 20,                   // Amount
    3: "ALICECOIN"           // Currency
  },
  4: "sig_k720f"            // Signature
}
```
CBOR enables efficient parsing while supporting conditional structures[2][9][20].

### Signing Requirements
- **Agent→Kernel**: Mandatory agent signature
- **Kernel→Kernel**: Mandatory kernel signature
- **Binding commitments**: Non-repudiable agent signatures

Verification process:
1. SHA-3 digest computation
2. Encryption with sender's private key
3. Recipient decryption with sender's public key
4. Comparison to freshly computed digest[5][12][20].

## Accounting and Storage Systems

### Double-Entry Implementation
Each message corresponds to balanced transaction:
- **ASK Creation**:
  ```plaintext
  DR Alice:ServiceReceivable    20 ALICECOIN
  CR Alice:PromiseLiability     20 ALICECOIN
  ```
- **BID Acceptance**:
  ```plaintext
  DR Bob:PromiseAsset           20 ALICECOIN
  CR Bob:CompensationPayable    20 ALICECOIN
  ```
Promise make/break events directly map to currency operations[4][15].

### Hypergraph Storage
All messages persist in hypergraph structures:
- Vertices represent agents, promises, events
- Hyperedges connect commitment participants
- Merkle links ensure tamper evidence[7][11][16]

This enables complex relationship modeling while maintaining cryptographic integrity[7][11].

## Distributed Communication Protocol

### Inter-Node Operation
Kernels implement federated communication:
- **ASK publication**: Hashed descriptors broadcast to peer kernels
- **BID routing**: Directed to kernel hosting matching ASK
- **Match execution**: Two-phase commit coordinating:
  - Ledger updates
  - Escrow management
  - Promise activation[1][6][23]

This approach eliminates direct inter-agent communication while enabling global market functionality[1][23].

## Conclusion

This architecture enables decentralized cooperation through kernel-mediated message passing with Mach-inspired IPC semantics. Promise Theory principles manifest through economic mechanisms where kept promises strengthen personal currencies and broken promises incur tangible costs. The hypergraph-based storage and CBOR message format ensure efficient handling of complex relationships while maintaining verifiable integrity across distributed systems.
