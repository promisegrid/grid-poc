# Distributed Agent Coordination System

This architecture establishes a trust-based cooperation framework where
autonomous agents interact exclusively through kernel-mediated message
passing. The kernel functions as universal counterparty and trusted third
party, implementing a strict client-server model where agents act as
clients and the kernel serves as both message broker and transaction
escrow.

## Kernel Architecture

The kernel provides three critical functions: (1) Universal counterparty
service assuming position in every transaction (2) Exclusive
communication brokerage routing all inter-agent messages (3) Resource
arbitration starting agents and allocating computational resources. This
design enforces that agents maintain no awareness of peer location or
infrastructure details, communicating strictly through kernel-mediated
message passing[1][5][13]. All network communication routes through
kernel infrastructure, with cross-machine messaging requiring kernel-
resigned messages for transit integrity[5][9][20].

## Promise Theory Implementation

### Fundamental Distinctions
The system rigorously maintains the critical Promise Theory separation
between: (1) **Requests**: Non-binding impositions attempting to
influence others (BID-type messages) (2) **Promises**: Voluntary
commitments about future behavior. This preserves Burgess' "voluntary
cooperation" principle where requests represent influence attempts while
promises constitute self-commitments[8][11][18].

### Bid Semantic Analysis
BID messages contain compensation offers that transform into binding
promissory commitments exclusively through explicit acceptance by ASK
providers. Until acceptance, these remain non-binding requests that can
be withdrawn without penalty, maintaining the essential distinction
between impositions and commitments[11][18].

### Conditional Transformation
Requests acquire binding properties solely through: (1) Explicit match
acceptance (2) Escrow collateralization (3) Multisignature agreements.
Compensation acceptance creates collateralized commitments where the
compensation offer transitions from non-binding request to enforceable
promise[11][13][18].

### Assessment Mechanisms
The kernel tracks: (1) Promise fulfillment rates (2) Compensation
timeliness (3) Service quality metrics. This data feeds reputation
algorithms influencing currency valuation, with broken promises
triggering reputation reserve debits while rejected requests incur no
ledger impact[3][8][14].

## Economic Trust Building

### Currency Mechanism
Personal currencies quantify trust through economic indicators: Promise
fulfillment drives exchange rate appreciation, service quality increases
transaction volume, and compensation speed improves market depth. The
kernel publishes anonymized fulfillment statistics that agents
incorporate into valuation models, with direct interaction history
receiving maximum weighting[4][10][14].

## Matching Engine Operation

### Core Algorithm
The kernel-local matching engine implements a deterministic price-time
priority algorithm: (1) Order intake (BID/ASK messages) (2) Signature
validation (3) Order book insertion (BIDS: descending price → ascending
time; ASKS: ascending price → ascending time) (4) Matching trigger
(BID.price ≥ ASK.price) (5) Execution of earliest compatible orders (6)
Escrow activation locking compensation and transferring service obligation
(7) Settlement through service verification and compensation release[6]
[13][17].

### Distributed Coordination
Cross-machine transactions use two-phase commit: (1) **Prepare phase**:
Resource verification across nodes (2) **Commit phase**: Atomic ledger
update. This protocol solves the K_Bob coordination problem by
guaranteeing all participating kernels either commit to the transaction
or roll back state changes[9][14][19]. ASK orders publish as Mach-style
ports via content-addressed hashes while BID orders target these hashes
across nodes, with successful matches recorded as hypergraph edges[7][19]
[21].

## Mach Kernel Similarities

The architecture shares key characteristics with Mach microkernel: (1)
**Syscall Analogy**: Agent requests mirror userspace-kernel syscalls (2)
**Capability Security**: Messages reference explicitly granted rights (3)
**Port Abstraction**: Virtual endpoints replace physical ports with ASK
orders functioning as Mach-style receive ports and BID orders constituting
messages sent to those ports (4) **Minimal Kernel**: Core functions
limited to routing and control[1][4][5][7].

## Data Representation

### CBOR Message Format
Messages use Concise Binary Object Representation:
```cbor
{
  1: "msg_0425",          // Content hash
  2: "ASK",                // Message type
  3: {                     // Body
    1: "service_S",        // Service description
    2: 20,                 // Compensation amount
    3: "ALICECOIN"         // Currency specification
  },
  4: "sig_a9b3c"          // Signature
```
Providing efficient parsing while supporting conditional promise
structures[2][10][15].

### Hypergraph Storage
Messages persist in hypergraph structures where: (1) Nodes represent
agents, services, currencies (2) Hyperedges connect transaction
participants (3) Content addressing enables tamper-evident retrieval.
Each message constitutes a balanced double-entry transaction recording
both service obligation and compensation commitment[7][15][21].

## Accounting System

### Double-Entry Implementation
All economic events follow strict accounting equivalency between promise
events and currency operations:
```
Promise Creation:
  Debit:  Receivable::Service
  Credit: Liability::Commitment

Promise Fulfillment:
  Debit:  Liability::Commitment
  Credit: Revenue::Service

Promise Breach:
  Debit:  Expense::Reputation
  Credit: Receivable::Service
```
Maintaining verifiable transaction integrity[3][14][20].

## Security Implementation

### Signing Requirements
- **Agent→Kernel**: Signed with agent's private key
- **Kernel→Kernel**: Signed with kernel's private key
- **Ledger Entries**: Kernel-signed for non-repudiation

### Verification Process
The kernel implements: (1) SHA-3 digest computation (2) Encryption with
sender's private key (3) Recipient decryption with sender's public key
(4) Digest comparison. This prevents spoofing while maintaining
non-repudiation[5][9][20].

## Conclusion

This architecture enables trust-based cooperation through kernel-mediated
message passing while preserving Promise Theory's core principles. The
distributed coordination protocol solves cross-node matching through
content-addressed ASK ports and two-phase commitment. Personal
currencies create measurable trust metrics that align individual behavior
with system-wide cooperation incentives.
