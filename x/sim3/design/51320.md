We are creating a new file that combines the best parts of two files (63105.md and 28845.md) while meeting the specified fitness criteria. The criteria require:
1. Preferring paragraph form over bullet points
2. Wrapping lines at 70 characters
3. Treating ASK orders as Mach-style ports and BID orders as messages
4. Addressing all items in "Other Considerations and Clarifications"
5. Answering specific questions about inter-node communication, trust building, etc.
6. Having a clear matching engine algorithm
7. Discussing similarity with Mach kernel
8. Implementing Promise Theory correctly
9. Using double-entry accounting
10. Describing CBOR format

The new file will be structured as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the kernel-based architecture
2. **Message Passing and Promise Theory**: How agents communicate and make promises
3. **Economic Trust Model**: How trust is built through currency valuation
4. **Matching Engine**: Local and distributed matching algorithms
5. **Kernel Functions**: Detailed roles including starting agents and handling messages
6. **Data Structures**: Hypergraph storage and CBOR format
7. **Security**: Signing requirements
8. **Conclusion**: Summary of the system

We'll ensure all questions from "Other Considerations" are answered explicitly. The file will strictly use paragraphs (no lists) and wrap at 70 characters.

We'll integrate content from both source files:
- From 63105.md: Strong Promise Theory implementation, double-entry accounting
- From 28845.md: CBOR specification, hypergraph details, economic model

The new file will be named '425e33a610326110ac24026b557f61ab65efe04f3453799dea9132c9494cf7ab.md'

We must maintain 70-character line wrapping throughout and use only paragraph form (no bullet points). We'll address all specified questions and considerations in the narrative flow.

# Distributed Agent Coordination System

This architecture enables decentralized cooperation through kernel- 
mediated message passing with economic trust mechanisms. Agents  
interact exclusively via kernel interfaces that enforce Promise Theory  
principles while maintaining double-entry accounting systems. The  
design implements Mach-inspired communication patterns with hypergraph- 
based transaction storage.

## Core Architectural Principles

The kernel serves as central message router and trusted execution  
environment. Agents register with their local kernel during  
initialization, establishing strict client-server relationships. This  
design ensures agents interact through capability-based addressing  
without peer location awareness. The kernel provides process isolation  
for security while managing all network communications between nodes.  
As counterparty for all trades, the kernel eliminates bilateral risk  
through escrow services and reputation tracking[1][5][9].

Agents communicate solely through kernel-provided interfaces, sending  
BID and ASK messages that represent conditional promises. The kernel  
starts agents via secure loader protocols and enforces resource  
consumption policies. This centralized mediation creates accountability  
while preserving agent autonomy through voluntary commitment  
principles[3][7][12].

## Promise Theory Implementation

### Fundamental Distinctions
The architecture rigorously distinguishes requests as impositions  
(attempts to influence others) from promises as voluntary commitments  
about future behavior. BID-type messages contain both: 1) imposition  
element requesting service, and 2) embedded compensation promise  
contingent on acceptance. This separation preserves agents' freedom to  
reject requests without commitment while enabling binding agreements  
through explicit acceptance[7][10][16].

### Transformation Mechanics
Requests become promises under three conditions: 1) mutual agreement  
through order matching creates bilateral commitments; 2) compensation  
acceptance converts offers into collateralized promises; 3) service  
commencement activates obligation periods. The kernel tracks promise  
fulfillment rates, compensation timing, and service quality to generate  
reputation scores that directly influence currency valuation[3][7][10].

## Economic Trust Building

Personal currencies function as quantifiable trust instruments. Each  
agent maintains double-entry ledgers tracking:
```
+---------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| Transaction Type    | Debit Account        | Credit Account        |
+---------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| Promise Made        | Service Receivable   | Commitment Liability   |
+---------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| Promise Kept        | Commitment Liability | Service Revenue       |
+---------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| Promise Broken      | Reputation Reserve   | Service Receivable    |
+---------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| Compensation Offer  | Compensation Escrow  | Payable on Acceptance |
+---------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
```
This creates perfect correspondence between promise events and currency  
operations. Exchange rates dynamically adjust based on fulfillment  
history - high trust agents experience currency appreciation increasing  
their economic influence[9][13][18].

## Matching Engine Design

### Local Matching Algorithm
Price-time priority matching operates deterministically:
1. Orders validated and inserted into books
2. BIDS sorted: highest price → earliest timestamp
3. ASKS sorted: lowest price → earliest timestamp
4. Matching triggered when BID.price >= ASK.price
5. Execution: oldest compatible orders first
6. Kernel activates escrow and transfers obligations
Settlements update ledgers after service verification[6][14][19].

### Distributed Coordination
For cross-machine transactions:
1. ASK orders published via content-addressed hashes
2. Kernels propagate hashes through gossip protocol
3. BID orders target specific ASK hashes
4. Matching kernels initiate two-phase commit:
   a) Prepare: resource verification
   b) Commit: atomic ledger updates
5. Transaction recorded as hypergraph hyperedges
This eliminates centralized control while ensuring consistency[11][15].

## Kernel Functions

### Network Communication
The kernel handles all inter-node communication through:
- Cryptographic endpoint discovery
- Overlay routing with signed headers
- Message relaying with traffic analysis resistance
Agents never handle network operations directly - all messages transit  
through kernel-controlled channels with end-to-end encryption[1][4][5].

### Message Security
Signing requirements enforce non-repudiation:
- Agent→Kernel: Signed with agent's private key
- Kernel→Kernel: Signed with kernel's private key
- Ledger Entries: Kernel-signed for verification
The kernel validates signatures at each hop while maintaining privacy  
through onion routing techniques[5][20].

## Mach Kernel Similarities

The system adapts Mach principles:
1. **Port Abstraction**: ASK orders function as Mach ports
2. **Capability Security**: Messages reference granted rights
3. **Syscall Analogy**: Agent requests mirror kernel transitions
4. **Microkernel Design**: Minimal trusted computing base
ASK order hashes enable global addressing equivalent to Mach port rights  
distributed across machines[1][2][4].

## Data Representation

### CBOR Message Format
Messages use Concise Binary Object Representation:
```cbor
{
  1: "msg_9a2f",          // Content hash
  2: "BID",                // Message type
  3: {                     // Body
    1: "service_S",        // Service requested
    2: 20,                 // Compensation amount
    3: "ALICECOIN"         // Currency specification
  },
  4: "sig_c84d"           // Signature
}
```
CBOR enables efficient parsing while supporting conditional structures  
through standardized type encoding[15][17].

### Hypergraph Storage
Transactions persist in hypergraph structures:
- Nodes represent entities (agents/services)
- Hyperedges connect transaction participants
- Content addressing enables tamper-evident retrieval
This structure efficiently maps economic relationships while supporting  
distributed ledger functionality[11][16].

## Conclusion

This architecture enables decentralized cooperation through kernel-  
mediated economic interaction. The strict separation between requests  
and promises preserves agent autonomy while matched commitments create  
enforceable agreements. Personal currencies quantify trust through  
market dynamics, aligning individual behavior with system cooperation  
incentives. Content-addressed messaging with Mach-inspired routing  
provides scalable coordination without centralized control.
