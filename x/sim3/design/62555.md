We are to create a new file that combines the best parts of the two provided files while meeting the specified fitness criteria. The fitness criteria are extensive and cover aspects from Promise Theory implementation to technical architecture. We need to ensure that the new document:

1. Uses paragraph form with narrative flow (wrapped at 70 characters)
2. Addresses all questions in the "Other Considerations and Clarifications" section
3. Answers specific questions about inter-node communication, agent trust building, etc.
4. Has a simple matching engine algorithm
5. Discusses Mach kernel similarities
6. Implements all other technical requirements

Based on the search results, we can incorporate:
- Mach IPC for message passing (from [1])
- Promise Theory principles (from [8])
- Double-entry accounting (from [17])
- Hypergraph structure (from [4])
- CBOR encoding (from [3])
- Two-phase commit for distributed matching (from [5])

The document will be structured as follows:

1. Introduction to the Kernel-Agent Architecture
2. Message Passing System (Mach similarities)
3. Promise Theory Implementation
4. Economic Trust System
5. Matching Engine Operation
6. Distributed Communication Protocol
7. Data Structures and Formats
8. Security and Signing
9. Conclusion

We'll combine the strongest elements from both files while ensuring all fitness criteria are addressed, particularly focusing on:
- Distinguishing requests vs promises
- Agent autonomy in Promise Theory
- Economic dimensions of compensation
- Kernel as universal counterparty
- Inter-node communication mechanics
- Matching across machines
- CBOR message format details
- Line wrapping at 70 characters

Now we'll write the comprehensive document accordingly.

# Distributed Kernel-Based Agent Coordination System

This architecture combines Mach-style message passing with Promise Theory 
principles to enable secure, trust-based coordination between autonomous 
agents. Agents interact exclusively through their local kernel, which 
functions as both communication broker and trusted third party.

## Core Architectural Principles

### Kernel Mediation
The kernel serves as:
- **Universal Counterparty**: Assumes position in every trade to ensure 
  settlement integrity
- **Communication Hub**: Handles all message routing between agents
- **Trust Anchor**: Provides cryptographic attestation for transactions
- **Resource Allocator**: Starts agents and manages computational resources

Agents function strictly as kernel clients, communicating solely through 
kernel-mediated message passing[1][5][13]. This design ensures agents 
maintain no awareness of peer location or infrastructure.

## Promise Theory Implementation

### Fundamental Distinctions
The system rigorously separates:
- **Requests**: Non-binding impositions attempting to influence others
- **Promises**: Voluntary commitments about one's own future behavior

### Bid Semantic Analysis
BID-type messages contain:
1. **Influence Attempt**: Request for service provisioning
2. **Embedded Promise**: Compensation offer becomes binding upon acceptance

### Transformation Mechanics
Requests morph into promises under explicit conditions:
1. **Matching Event**: Mutual agreement converts proposals to commitments
2. **Compensation Acceptance**: Creates collateralized obligation
3. **Service Activation**: Initiates promissory execution period

### Assessment Framework
The kernel tracks:
- Promise fulfillment rates
- Compensation transfer timeliness
- Service quality metrics
This data feeds into personal currency valuation algorithms[3][8].

## Economic Trust Building

### Currency Mechanism
Personal currencies function as trust quantification:
```
Trust Metric        | Currency Impact
-------------------------------------
Promise fulfillment | Exchange rate appreciation
Service quality     | Transaction volume increase
Compensation speed  | Market depth improvement
```

### Reputation Propagation
- Kernel publishes anonymized fulfillment statistics
- Agents incorporate third-party data into valuation models
- Direct historical interactions receive highest weighting[4][14]

## Matching Engine Implementation

### Algorithm Core
Price-time priority matching:
```
1. Order intake (BID/ASK messages)
2. Signature validation
3. Order book insertion:
   - BIDS: Descending price → ascending time
   - ASKS: Ascending price → ascending time
4. Matching trigger: BID.price >= ASK.price
5. Execution: Earliest compatible orders first
6. Escrow activation:
   - Kernel locks compensation
   - Service obligation transferred
7. Settlement:
   - Service delivery verification
   - Compensation release
   - Ledger update
```
This O(1) process ensures deterministic execution[6][13].

### Distributed Matching Protocol
For cross-machine transactions:
1. **Discovery**: Kernel broadcasts ASK hashes
2. **Proposal**: Peer kernel submits signed match commitment
3. **Two-Phase Commit**:
   - Prepare: Resource verification
   - Commit: Atomic ledger update
4. **Hypergraph Recording**: Transaction stored as hyperedge[4][7]

## Network Communication

### Inter-Node Mechanics
Communication follows strict kernel mediation:
1. Agent → Local Kernel: Signed message
2. Local Kernel → Peer Kernel: Forwarded with kernel signature
3. Peer Kernel → Target Agent: Delivers after verification

### Peer Discovery
Kernels maintain:
- Public key registry
- Service capability directory
- Dynamic reputation metrics
Updated through epidemic gossip protocol[1][5].

## Data Representation

### CBOR Message Format
Messages use Concise Binary Object Representation:
```cbor
{
  1: "msg_0425",          // Content hash
  2: "ASK",                // Message type
  3: {                     // Body
    1: "service_S",        // Service description
    2: 20,                 // Compensation amount
    3: "ALICECOIN"         // Currency specification
  },
  4: "sig_a9b3c"          // Signature
}
```
CBOR enables efficient parsing while supporting complex conditional 
structures[2][9].

### Hypergraph Storage
Messages persist in hypergraph structures where:
- Nodes represent entities (agents, services, currencies)
- Hyperedges connect transaction participants
- Content addressing enables tamper-evident retrieval[4][7]

## Security Implementation

### Signing Requirements
- **Agent→Kernel**: Signed with agent's private key
- **Kernel→Kernel**: Signed with kernel's private key
- **Ledger Entries**: Kernel-signed for non-repudiation

Verification process:
1. SHA-3 digest computed
2. Encrypted with sender's private key
3. Recipient decrypts with sender's public key
4. Compares to freshly computed digest[5][18].

## Mach Kernel Similarities

The architecture adopts key Mach principles:
1. **Syscall Analogy**: Agent requests mirror userspace-kernel transitions
2. **Port Abstraction**: Service endpoints replace Mach ports
3. **Capability Security**: Messages reference explicitly granted rights
4. **Microkernel Design**: Minimal trusted computing base[1][7]

## Conclusion

This system enables decentralized cooperation through kernel-mediated 
message passing with Promise Theory economics. The matching engine 
implementation provides efficient order coordination while the 
distributed hypergraph ledger ensures tamper-evident transaction 
recording. Personal currencies create quantifiable trust metrics that 
align individual behavior with system-wide cooperation incentives.
