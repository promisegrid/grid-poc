# Distributed Agent System with Kernel-Mediated Promise Exchange

This document details an architecture where autonomous agents interact exclusively through kernel-mediated message passing. The system implements Promise Theory principles where requests represent impositions attempting to influence others, while promises constitute voluntary commitments about future behavior. All communication occurs via function call-style messages to the local kernel, which serves as universal counterparty and trusted third party. The design enables decentralized trust building through personal currency valuation tied to promise fulfillment rates.

## Message Passing System Architecture

Agents communicate exclusively with their local kernel through function call messages formatted in CBOR. Each message contains:

1. **Function identifier**: Specifies requested kernel action  
2. **Parameters**: Inputs for function execution  
3. **Conditional promises**: Commitments contingent on message processing  
4. **Balanced accounting entries**: Double-entry transactions  

The kernel provides four core services:  
- **Message routing**: Agents communicate by addressing messages to kernel ports rather than peer agents. The kernel determines message destinations and handles network forwarding.  
- **Resource allocation**: Kernel regulates computational resources by prioritizing messages from high-trust agents.  
- **Promise enforcement**: Tracks promise fulfillment and executes penalty transactions.  
- **Agent lifecycle**: Spawns and terminates agent processes.  

This mirrors Mach's kernel design where:  
- Messages function as remote procedure calls to kernel ports[1][7]  
- Kernels hold exclusive rights to message queues during transit[9]  
- All network communication occurs kernel-to-kernel[6][14]  

Agents have no direct awareness of peers - knowledge is limited to kernel interfaces. When Agent Alice sends to Agent Bob:  
1. Alice → Kernel_A: Signed message for Bob  
2. Kernel_A → Kernel_B: Forwarded with kernel signature  
3. Kernel_B → Bob: Delivered after verification  
This creates location transparency where agents interact with logical ports rather than physical nodes[2][9][14].

## Promise Theory Implementation

The system rigorously applies Promise Theory:

### Request-Promise Distinction
- **BID/ASK orders**: Represent impositions attempting to influence market behavior  
- **Matched orders**: Transform into binding unilateral promises  

### Voluntary Cooperation
- Agents freely submit/cancel unmatched orders without commitment  
- Kernel cannot compel promise acceptance  

### Economic Dimensions
- Compensation terms ("Pay 20 X-coins") become value-transfer promises upon matching  
- Service descriptions become performance commitments  

### Assessment Mechanisms
- Kernel tracks:  
  - Promise fulfillment rates  
  - Payment timeliness  
  - Service quality metrics  
- Data feeds currency valuation algorithms  

### Failure Differentiation
- **Broken promises**: Recorded in ledger, trigger currency devaluation  
- **Rejected requests**: No ledger impact beyond opportunity cost  

This framework ensures agents retain autonomy while creating enforceable commitments only through voluntary matching[10][36].

## Economic Trust Building

Personal currencies quantify trust through three mechanisms:

1. **Currency Valuation**:  
   - Exchange rates dynamically adjust based on promise fulfillment rates  
   - Agents maintaining >95% fulfillment enjoy strongest currencies  

2. **Trust Propagation**:  
   - Kernel publishes anonymized fulfillment statistics  
   - Agents incorporate third-party data into valuation models  

3. **Consequence Framework**:  
   - Chronic promise-breakers face currency devaluation  
   - High-trust agents receive resource priority  

This creates incentive alignment where reliable promise-keeping improves economic standing[4][12][37].

## Distributed Matching Protocol

### Local Matching Algorithm
1. Kernel maintains price-time priority order book  
2. New BID order checks for matching ASK orders:  
   - Service/currency exact match required  
   - Highest priced ASK first (for BID)  
   - Earliest ASK first at equal prices  
3. On match:  
   - Orders convert to binding promises  
   - Kernel creates double-entry escrow:  
     ```plaintext
     Escrow Account:      +20 ALICE_coins  
     Bob's ALICE_account: -20 ALICE_coins  

     Escrow Account:      -1 Service_S  
     Alice's Service_S:   +1 Service_S  
     ```  
   - Service execution triggers settlement  

### Cross-Machine Matching
1. **Discovery**:  
   - Kernel_A broadcasts ASK hashes to peers  
   - Kernel_B checks against local BID orders  

2. **Locking**:  
   - Kernel_B sends signed match proposal  
   - Both kernels freeze matched orders  

3. **Commit**:  
   - Kernels exchange two-phase commit certificates  
   - Create cross-kernel escrow entries  
   - Update distributed hypergraph ledger[11][16]  

The algorithm runs in O(1) time for order book operations[17][21].

## Kernel Operations

The kernel functions as:

1. **Universal Counterparty**:  
   - Assumes contractual position in all transactions  
   - Guarantees settlement regardless of agent status  

2. **Economic Regulator**:  
   - Buys services at ask prices, sells at bid prices  
   - Charges transaction fees to regulate resource usage  

3. **Network Mediator**:  
   - Exclusively handles inter-node communication  
   - Maintains distributed hash table for agent location  

Agents interact solely through kernel ports, with no direct peer awareness. This architecture enables security and mobility while maintaining promise accountability[14][18][28].

## Security Implementation

### Message Signing Protocol
- **Local messages**: Signed with agent's private key  
- **Inter-kernel messages**: Signed with kernel's private key  
- Verification process:  
  1. SHA-3 digest computation  
  2. ECDSA signature generation  
  3. Recipient verification with sender's public key  

### Authentication Flow
```plaintext
Agent → Kernel: [Function_ID, Params, Signature]  
Kernel_A → Kernel_B: [Forwarded_Message, Kernel_Signature]  
Kernel_B → Agent: [Delivered_Message]  
```
Digital signatures ensure non-repudiation and tamper evidence[5][11].

## Data Architecture

### Hypergraph Ledger
Transactions store in hypergraph structure where:  
- Vertices represent: agents, kernels, promises  
- Hyperedges connect: transaction participants  
Enables:  
- Promise dependency tracing  
- Multi-party transaction retrieval  
- Reputation graph analysis  

### Double-Entry Accounting
Each transaction maintains balance:  
```plaintext
BID Order:  
  Bob:     Currency Asset -20, Kernel Escrow +20  
  Kernel:  Currency Liability +20, Bob Escrow -20  

Promise Fulfillment:  
  Alice:   Service Asset -1, Currency Receivable +20  
  Kernel:  Escrow Release -20 Alice_coins, +20 Alice_coins  
  Bob:     Service Liability -1, Currency Payable +20  
```
Promise make/break events generate equivalent currency transfers[4][37].

## Conclusion

This architecture enables decentralized cooperation through:  
1. Kernel-mediated message passing providing process isolation  
2. Promise Theory implementation preserving agent autonomy  
3. Economic trust system quantifying reliability  

Future work includes implementing zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving reputation verification and optimizing hypergraph traversal algorithms for large-scale deployment.
