We'll combine the strongest elements from both files while ensuring all fitness criteria are addressed, particularly focusing on:
- Distinguishing requests vs promises

# Distributed Kernel-Based Agent Coordination System

This architecture combines Mach-style message passing with Promise Theory 
principles to enable secure, trust-based coordination between autonomous 
agents. Agents interact exclusively through their local kernel, which 
functions as both communication broker and trusted third party.

## Core Architectural Principles

### Kernel Mediation
The kernel serves as:
- **Universal Counterparty**: Assumes position in every trade to ensure 
  settlement integrity
- **Communication Hub**: Handles all message routing between agents
- **Trust Anchor**: Provides cryptographic attestation for transactions
- **Resource Allocator**: Starts agents and manages computational resources

Agents function strictly as kernel clients, communicating solely through 
kernel-mediated message passing[1][5][13]. This design ensures agents 
maintain no awareness of peer location or infrastructure.

## Promise Theory Implementation

### Fundamental Distinctions
The system rigorously separates:
- **Requests**: Non-binding impositions attempting to influence others
- **Promises**: Voluntary commitments about one's own future behavior

### Bid Semantic Analysis
BID-type messages contain:
1. **Influence Attempt**: Request for service provisioning
2. **Embedded Promise**: Compensation offer becomes binding upon acceptance

### Transformation Mechanics
Requests morph into promises under explicit conditions:
1. **Matching Event**: Mutual agreement converts proposals to commitments
2. **Compensation Acceptance**: Creates collateralized obligation
3. **Service Activation**: Initiates promissory execution period

### Assessment Framework
The kernel tracks:
- Promise fulfillment rates
- Compensation transfer timeliness
- Service quality metrics
This data feeds into personal currency valuation algorithms[3][18].

## Economic Trust Building

### Currency Mechanism
Personal currencies function as trust quantification:
```
Trust Metric        | Currency Impact
-------------------------------------
Promise fulfillment | Exchange rate appreciation
Service quality     | Transaction volume increase
Compensation speed  | Market depth improvement
```

### Reputation Propagation
- Kernel publishes anonymized fulfillment statistics
- Agents incorporate third-party data into valuation models
- Direct historical interactions receive highest weighting[4][14]

## Matching Engine Implementation

### Algorithm Core
Price-time priority matching:
```
1. Order intake (BID/ASK messages)
2. Signature validation
3. Order book insertion:
   - BIDS: Descending price → ascending time
   - ASKS: Ascending price → ascending time
4. Matching trigger: BID.price >= ASK.price
5. Execution: Earliest compatible orders first
6. Escrow activation:
   - Kernel locks compensation
   - Service obligation transferred
7. Settlement:
   - Service delivery verification
   - Compensation release
   - Ledger update
```
This O(1) process ensures deterministic execution[6][17].

### Distributed Matching Protocol
For cross-machine transactions:
1. **Discovery**: Kernel broadcasts ASK hashes
2. **Proposal**: Peer kernel submits signed match commitment
3. **Two-Phase Commit**:
   - Prepare: Resource verification
   - Commit: Atomic ledger update
4. **Hypergraph Recording**: Transaction stored as hyperedge[7][21]

## Network Communication

### Inter-Node Mechanics
Communication follows strict kernel mediation:
1. Agent → Local Kernel: Signed message
2. Local Kernel → Peer Kernel: Forwarded with kernel signature
3. Peer Kernel → Target Agent: Delivers after verification

### Peer Discovery
Kernels maintain:
- Public key registry
- Service capability directory
- Dynamic reputation metrics
Updated through epidemic gossip protocol[1][5].

## Data Representation

### CBOR Message Format
Messages use Concise Binary Object Representation:
```cbor
{
  1: "msg_0425",          // Content hash
  2: "ASK",                // Message type
  3: {                     // Body
    1: "service_S",        // Service description
    2: 20,                 // Compensation amount
    3: "ALICECOIN"         // Currency specification
  },
  4: "sig_a9b3c"          // Signature
}
```
CBOR enables efficient parsing while supporting complex conditional 
structures[2][9].

### Hypergraph Storage
Messages persist in hypergraph structures where:
- Nodes represent entities (agents, services, currencies)
- Hyperedges connect transaction participants
- Content addressing enables tamper-evident retrieval[7][11]

## Security Implementation

### Signing Requirements
- **Agent→Kernel**: Signed with agent's private key
- **Kernel→Kernel**: Signed with kernel's private key
- **Ledger Entries**: Kernel-signed for non-repudiation

Verification process:
1. SHA-3 digest computed
2. Encrypted with sender's private key
3. Recipient decrypts with sender's public key
4. Compares to freshly computed digest[5][19].

## Mach Kernel Similarities

The architecture adopts key Mach principles:
1. **Syscall Analogy**: Agent requests mirror userspace-kernel transitions
2. **Port Abstraction**: Service endpoints replace Mach ports
3. **Capability Security**: Messages reference explicitly granted rights
4. **Microkernel Design**: Minimal trusted computing base[1][5]

## Conclusion

This system enables decentralized cooperation through kernel-mediated 
message passing with Promise Theory economics. The matching engine 
implementation provides efficient order coordination while the 
distributed hypergraph ledger ensures tamper-evident transaction 
recording. Personal currencies create quantifiable trust metrics that 
align individual behavior with system-wide cooperation incentives.
