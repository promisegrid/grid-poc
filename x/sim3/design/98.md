# Distributed Agent Coordination System: Kernel-Mediated Message Passing with Economic Trust

This system implements a trust-based coordination framework where autonomous agents interact exclusively through a central kernel using message passing. Agents function as clients that communicate solely with their local kernel instance, which serves as trusted intermediary, transaction counterparty, and network orchestrator. Communication follows Mach-inspired principles with CBOR-encoded messages representing conditional promises stored in hypergraph structures. Trust emerges from promise-keeping behavior tracked through double-entry accounting of personal currencies, where kept promises enhance reputational capital while broken promises incur economic penalties.

## Inter-Node Communication Protocol

Inter-node communication operates through strict kernel-centric messaging where agents exclusively send requests to and receive responses from their local kernel. The process unfolds as:
1. **Local Submission**: Agent signs request with private key and delivers to kernel
2. **Kernel Processing**: Validates signature, checks permissions, applies logic
3. **Network Routing**: For remote agents, kernel signs with its key and forwards
4. **Destination Delivery**: Receiving kernel verifies signatures before agent delivery[1][5][8]
This architecture ensures agents remain unaware of peer locations while kernels manage all network communication. The kernel acts as trusted third party for all transactions—when Agent A performs service for Agent B, the kernel serves as counterparty to both parties: A receives compensation from kernel while B pays kernel, with the kernel guaranteeing settlement[1][4][14].

## Agent Communication and Trust Architecture

Agents build trust through voluntary promise exchanges mediated by the kernel:
1. **Promise Proposal**: Agent publishes ASK order ("I promise service S if paid X coins")
2. **Counterparty Evaluation**: Agents assess historical promise-keeping rates
3. **Binding Acceptance**: Matching transforms request into collateralized promise
Trust quantifies through personal currency valuation:
- **Kept Promises**: Increase currency demand/appreciation
- **Broken Promises**: Devalue currency via penalty transactions[10][13][16]
This creates economic feedback where reliability becomes tangible asset, with kernel maintaining double-entry ledgers tracking all currency movements[9][14][16].

## Agent Isolation Principle

Agents maintain strict isolation—they know only the kernel, not other agents:
- **No Direct Addressing**: Agents reference peers by cryptographic ID only
- **Kernel Mediation**: All interaction requires kernel routing
- **Anonymity Preservation**: Physical locations obscured[3][5][12]
The kernel starts agents as its clients, providing resources and communication channels while enforcing security policies. Agents function as unprivileged entities that depend entirely on kernel services for existence and interaction[1][4][19].

## Matching Engine Implementation

The kernel employs transparent price-time priority matching:
```
1. Order intake: Signed BID/ASK messages arrive
2. Validation: Verify signatures and account balances
3. Order book insertion:
   • BID: Descending price then ascending time
   • ASK: Ascending price then ascending time
4. Matching: When BID.price >= ASK.price
   • Execute at asker's price
   • Prioritize earliest compatible orders
5. Escrow activation: Lock compensation in kernel accounts
6. Settlement: Transfer after promise fulfillment
```
The kernel regulates resource allocation by "buying low" (favoring high-value promises) and "selling high" (allocating resources to premium commitments), creating market-driven coordination[6][12][20].

## Mach Kernel Parallels

The message-passing system shares core similarities with Mach IPC:
1. **Port Analogy**: Kernel endpoints replace Mach ports
2. **Capability Security**: Rights-based message authorization
3. **Memory Marshaling**: Secure data transfer between protection domains
4. **Queue Management**: Ordered delivery guarantees[1][5][7]
Unlike Mach, this system adds cryptographic non-repudiation and economic enforcement layers while maintaining the microkernel's minimal trusted computing base[2][4][8].

## Message Structure and Accounting

### CBOR-Encoded Messages
Messages use Concise Binary Object Representation:
```cbor
{
  1: "promise_0815",        // Message ID
  2: "PT/1.0",              // Protocol version
  3: {                       // Body
    1: "service_guarantee", // Promise type
    2: {"duration": "3h"},  // Conditions
    3: {                     // Compensation
      1: 750,               // Amount
      2: "BOBCOIN"          // Currency
    }
  },
  4: "sig_8fh72a"           // Ed25519 signature
}
```
This format enables efficient parsing while supporting complex conditional structures[11][15][18].

### Double-Entry Accounting
Each message corresponds to balanced transaction:
```example
Alice promises service to Bob:
  DR Alice:ServiceReceivable    500 ALICECOIN
  CR Alice:PromiseLiability     500 ALICECOIN

Bob accepts promise:
  DR Bob:PromiseAsset           500 ALICECOIN
  CR Bob:CompensationPayable    500 ALICECOIN
```
Promise make/break events directly map to currency operations—keeping promises credits the maker's account while breaking them debits reputation reserves[9][14][16].

### Hypergraph Storage
Messages persist in hypergraph structures where:
- Vertices represent agents, promises, events
- Hyperedges connect commitment participants
- Merkle links ensure tamper evidence[10][17]
This enables complex relationship modeling while maintaining cryptographic integrity through content addressing[10][17].

## Promise Theory Implementation

### Core Tenets
The architecture enforces Promise Theory principles:
- **Requests**: Non-binding impositions (e.g., BID orders)
- **Promises**: Voluntary commitments binding upon acceptance
- **Voluntary Cooperation**: No obligation until explicit agreement[13][18][21]
BID-type requests contain embedded compensation offers that transform into binding promises only upon explicit matching, preserving agents' freedom to reject requests without consequence[13][18].

### Economic Framing
Value transfer occurs through:
1. **Compensation Promises**: Embedded in requests
2. **Collateralization**: Assets backing commitments
3. **Reputation Bonds**: Performance guarantees[10][13]
These implement Burgess' voluntary cooperation framework—requests initiate bidirectional negotiation while promises establish unilateral commitments with economic consequences[13][18][21].

### Failure Consequences
The system differentiates:
- **Broken Promises**: Trigger compensation forfeiture and reputation penalties
- **Rejected Requests**: No penalty beyond opportunity cost
- **Unfulfilled Requests**: Affect credibility without contractual penalty[10][13]
This distinction models real-world trust dynamics where voluntary commitments carry greater weight than negotiation attempts.

## Kernel Operational Roles

The kernel serves critical functions:
1. **Trusted Third Party**: Enforces promise execution
2. **Universal Counterparty**: Intermediates all transactions
3. **Resource Orchestrator**: Starts/stops agents
4. **Network Mediator**: Handles all cross-node communication
5. **Economic Regulator**: Manages currency valuation[4][14][19]
Agents exclusively communicate with the kernel, which handles all security (signing local messages), networking (forwarding to remote kernels), and economic enforcement (applying penalties).

## Conclusion

This architecture enables trustless cooperation through cryptographically enforced voluntary commitments. By implementing strict kernel-mediated message passing with Mach-inspired IPC semantics, the system provides robust coordination while preserving agent autonomy. Promise Theory principles manifest through economic mechanisms where kept promises strengthen personal currencies and broken promises incur tangible costs. The hypergraph-based storage and CBOR message format ensure efficient handling of complex commitment relationships while maintaining verifiable integrity.
