We are combining the two files into a new file that meets all fitness criteria. The fitness criteria require addressing specific questions, implementing Promise Theory correctly, describing the matching engine, and more.

Key points from the files:
- Both files describe a kernel-centric architecture with agents communicating only through the kernel
- They implement Promise Theory with requests as impositions and promises as voluntary commitments
- Both use double-entry accounting for promises
- They describe the message format and storage

Plan for the new file:
1. **Title and Introduction**: Combine the titles and introduce the integrated system.

2. **Kernel Role**:
   - Describe kernel as trusted third party and server that starts agents
   - Clarify kernel is counterparty for trades only in settlement, not obligations
   - Remove "kernel-mediated channels" language, use "message-passing system"

3. **Communication Model**:
   - Explicitly answer: agents only talk to kernel, kernel handles network communication
   - Describe message signing: local messages signed by agents, network messages signed by kernel

4. **Promise Theory Implementation**:
   - Distinguish requests (impositions) from promises (voluntary commitments)
   - Analyze BID requests containing compensation offers as embedded promises
   - Explain how compensation acceptance creates binding commitments
   - Describe assessment mechanisms for promise tracking
   - Discuss economic dimensions and failure consequences

5. **Matching Engine**:
   - Describe price-time priority algorithm simply
   - Explain kernel's role as market maker buying low and selling high

6. **Accounting**:
   - Use double-entry accounting for personal currencies
   - Show equivalence between promise make/break and currency transactions

7. **Message Format**:
   - Describe CBOR format with examples
   - Explain messages as conditional promises and balanced transactions

8. **Storage**:
   - Describe hypergraph structure for message storage

9. **Mach Kernel Similarity**:
   - Discuss similarity with Mach kernel's message-passing model

10. **Conclusion**: Synthesize the architecture

The new file will be in markdown format, with 70-character line wrapping. We'll ensure all fitness criteria are addressed, particularly:
- Answering the three key questions explicitly
- Correct Promise Theory application
- Clear matching engine description
- Internal consistency

# Kernel-Centric Message Passing Architecture with Promise-Based Coordination

## Core Architecture Principles

The system implements a strict **message-passing architecture** where every 
inter-node communication constitutes a function call to the kernel[1][5][9]. 
Agents interact exclusively through kernel-mediated message passing, analogous 
to the Mach microkernel's IPC model[1][4][5]. The kernel serves as:

- **Trusted Third Party**: Provides cryptographic attestation and state 
  synchronization
- **Resource Manager**: Starts agents and allocates computational resources
- **Market Facilitator**: Operates automated market maker functions
- **Settlement Enforcer**: Guarantees atomic transaction completion[2][6][10]

Agents function as clients to the kernel server, with all economic exchanges 
occurring bilaterally between agents while the kernel provides settlement 
infrastructure without assuming counterparty risk[5][9][11].

## Communication Model

### Agent-Kernel Exclusivity
All interactions follow the pattern:
```plaintext
Agent → Kernel: Request (e.g., "Deliver message to Agent B")
Kernel → Target Agent: Forwarded request
Agent → Kernel: Response
Kernel → Original Agent: Deliver response
```
This answers critical design questions:
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Agents communicate exclusively through kernel 
  message passing[3][5][8]
- **Network Handling**: Kernel manages routing/discovery but permits direct data 
  transfers post-handshake[4][8][13]
- **Signing Requirements**: Local messages require agent signatures; networked 
  messages add kernel routing signatures[5][8][20]

## Promise Theory Implementation

### Core Tenets
The architecture enforces ontological separation between:
- **Requests**: Non-binding impositions attempting influence
- **Promises**: Voluntary commitments about future behavior[7][11][16]

BID-type messages contain compensation offers that transform into binding 
promises only upon explicit acceptance:
```
+------------------+------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Message Type     | Primary Nature         | Binding Transformation        |
+------------------+------------------------+-------------------------------+
| BID Request      | Non-binding imposition | Upon counterparty acceptance   |
| Compensation     | Value-transfer promise | Execution upon fulfillment    |
+------------------+------------------------+-------------------------------+
```
This preserves Burgess' voluntary cooperation principle: agents freely accept or 
reject requests without commitment[10][12][16].

### Failure Differentiation
The system enforces consequence asymmetry:
- **Broken Promises**: Trigger reputation penalties and compensation forfeiture
- **Rejected Requests**: Incur only transaction abandonment
- **Unfulfilled Requests**: Affect credibility but lack contractual consequences[5][8][13]

## Matching Engine Implementation

The kernel employs transparent **price-time priority matching**:
```
1. Collect BID/ASK messages
2. Validate signatures and balances
3. Sort orders:
   - BIDs: Descending price
   - ASKs: Ascending price
4. Match when BID.price >= ASK.price
5. Execute sequentially:
   a. Lock compensation in escrow
   b. Transfer service obligations
   c. Atomically settle upon completion
6. Update ledger entries
```
The kernel regulates resource allocation by:
- Buying services at ASK prices (low)
- Selling services at BID prices (high)
- Profiting from spreads to prioritize high-value interactions[21][26][34]

## Double-Entry Promise Accounting

Promises are tracked as personal currencies using balanced accounting:
```
+------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Transaction            | Debit                 | Credit                |
+------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Promise Made (Service) | Service Receivable    | Commitment Liability  |
| Promise Kept           | Commitment Liability  | Service Revenue       |
| Promise Broken         | Reputation Reserve    | Service Receivable    |
+------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
```
Promise make/break events directly map to currency operations, establishing 
promise-currency equivalence[37][39][40].

## Message Specification

### CBOR Format
Messages use Concise Binary Object Representation:
```cbor
{
  1: "msg_0425",             // Message ID
  2: {                        // Payload
    1: {                      // Request
      1: "compute_result"     // Action
    },
    2: {                      // Offer
      1: {                    // Compensation
        1: 1500               // Amount
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Each message constitutes a **conditional promise** where:
- Service execution is promised upon compensation acceptance
- Compensation transfer is promised upon service verification
- Ledger annotations ensure double-entry balance[17][19][33]

### Hypergraph Storage
Messages persist in hypergraph structures where:
- Nodes represent agents, messages, commitments
- Hyperedges model multi-party relationships
- Content addressing enables tamper-evident retrieval[18][32]

## Mach Kernel Similarities

The architecture shares key characteristics:
1. **Syscall Analogy**: Agent requests mirror userspace-kernel syscalls
2. **Capability Security**: Messages reference explicitly granted rights
3. **Port Abstraction**: Endpoints replace Mach ports
4. **Minimal Kernel**: Core functions limited to routing and control[1][5][9]

## Direct Questions Answered

### "Do agents know each other?"
Agents interact through cryptographic identifiers without direct awareness. The 
kernel maintains a capability-based access matrix where:
- Agents specify message recipients by public key
- Kernel verifies pairwise authorization
- No global agent directory exists[3][5][13]

### "How do agents build trust?"
Trust emerges through:
1. **Observable Promise Fulfillment**: Public ledger tracks commitment history
2. **Compensation-at-Risk**: Staked currency backing promises
3. **Reputation Premiums**: Higher compensation for reliable agents
4. **Gradual Exposure**: Slowly increasing engagement limits[5][10][31]

### "How does inter-node communication work?"
Communication follows strict kernel mediation:
1. Agent signs request addressed to recipient's public key
2. Kernel verifies signatures and routing permissions
3. Kernel forwards message to recipient's message queue
4. Recipient processes message and submits response
5. Kernel delivers response to original sender[1][5][8]
