### Situational Semantics Framework

This perspective contends that requests transform into promises under
specific **contextual conditions**. Three transformation thresholds
exist:
1. **Escrow Activation**: When collateral binds the request
2. **Reputation Staking**: When refusal damages requester standing
3. **Implicit Contract Formation**: When systemic norms enforce reciprocity[1][2]

### Implementation-Specific Manifestations

Protocol design choices determine request-promise equivalence:
- **Bilateral discovery protocols**: Requests remain distinct
- **Escrowed transactions**: Requests become conditional promises
- **Reputation-based systems**: Blurred distinction through trust enforcement[1][5]

Private currency systems demonstrate this continuum: bank-issued
currencies create request environments, while asset-backed private
currencies transform requests into collateralized promises[3][20]. The
architectural choices determine semantic equivalence rather than
inherent properties[3][8].

## Implementation Considerations for Hybrid Systems

### Promise-Request Unified Protocol Architecture

Advanced systems can implement a **graded commitment framework** using:
```go
type Commitment struct {
    Initiator   AgentID
    Recipient   AgentID
    Resource    ResourceDescriptor
    Conditions  ConditionSet
    CommitmentLevel int // 0=Request, 1=Soft Promise, 2=Escrowed Promise
}
```
This structure enables flexible interpretation based on context while
maintaining auditability through the commitment level parameter[4][7].

### Kernel-Mediated Trust Enforcement

The system kernel should implement **asymmetric reputation accounting**:
- **Promise fulfillment/failure**: Directly impacts promiser reputation
- **Request compliance**: Impacts recipient reputation
- **Request acknowledgment**: Impacts requester reputation[1][6]

This creates balanced trust incentives while preserving semantic
distinctions through differential reputation impacts[1][2][5].
