# Requests Versus Promises in Autonomous System Design

In Promise Theory, a request is fundamentally distinct from a promise:
requests represent impositions attempting to influence another agent's
behavior, while promises constitute voluntary commitments about one's
own future actions. This distinction arises from Promise Theory's core
tenet of agent autonomy—each entity maintains exclusive control over
its commitments. However, complex scenarios exist where requests
contain embedded promises, particularly in compensation-based
interactions. When Agent A requests Agent B to perform Task X while
offering compensation Y, the compensation offer transforms into a
binding promise upon B's acceptance, creating a collateralized
commitment within the request framework. This nuanced relationship
demonstrates how protocols can blend imposition and commitment while
preserving the foundational autonomy principle[1][2][3][4][12].

## Foundational Principles of Promise Theory

### Autonomy and Voluntary Commitments

Promise Theory centers on **agent autonomy**, asserting that entities
can only make enforceable commitments about their own future behavior.
This principle rejects obligation-based models where external commands
dictate actions. Promises emerge when an agent voluntarily publishes
its intentions, creating expectations that other agents may freely
assess and utilize. For example, a server agent may promise
"availability between 9-5 EST," establishing an observable commitment
without compelling others' behavior. This voluntary publication
distinguishes promises from impositions like commands or requests,
which inherently attempt to override another agent's autonomy[1][4][9].

### Impositions as Negotiation Initiators

Requests function as **bidirectional negotiation triggers** rather
than commitments. When Agent A requests action from Agent B, it
constitutes an imposition—an attempt to influence B's behavior
without guaranteeing B's compliance. The autonomy principle guarantees
B's freedom to accept, reject, or ignore the request without
commitment penalty. For instance, a client agent requesting data from
a server imposes no obligation on the server; the server remains free
to fulfill, delay, or deny based on its internal priorities. This
preserves the critical distinction: requests initiate negotiations
while promises establish unilateral commitments[3][6][12][22].

## Compensation Frameworks as Embedded Promises

### BID-Type Request Structures

In scenarios combining requests with compensation offers (BID
patterns), the request remains an imposition while the compensation
transforms into a binding promise upon acceptance. Consider this
protocol:

1. Agent A requests Resource X from Agent B
2. Agent A offers Compensation Y (embedded promise)
3. Agent B accepts compensation offer (binding the promise)
4. Agent A provides Y upon B's delivery of X

Here, the compensation offer (step 2) becomes a validated promise
upon B's acceptance (step 3), creating economic reciprocity while
maintaining the request's non-binding nature. The request itself
remains an imposition until B voluntarily converts it into mutual
commitment through acceptance[3][6][13][26].

### Assessment Mechanisms

Embedded promises within requests require specialized **assessment
protocols**. For compensation promises, systems track:
- **Fulfillment verification**: Did Y transfer occur upon X delivery?
- **Timeliness metrics**: Was compensation provided within agreed windows?
- **Value consistency**: Did delivered Y match promised specifications?
These assessment parameters differ from pure promise tracking, as they
evaluate conditional commitments activated through negotiation rather
than unilateral declarations[1][4][6][12].

## Directionality and Transformation Dynamics

### Negotiation versus Commitment

The directional flow reveals core distinctions:
- **Requests**: Bidirectional negotiation flows (A→B initiation, B→A response)
- **Promises**: Unilateral commitment streams (A→B announcement)
This manifests in protocol designs where requests require
acknowledgement channels for counter-offers or rejections, while
promises utilize publication channels without response expectations.
The temporal dimension further differentiates them: promises commit
future states immediately, whereas requests only establish commitments
through subsequent acceptance actions[3][18][22].

### Contextual Transformation Thresholds

Requests morph into promise-bearing structures under specific
conditions:
1. **Compensation acceptance**: When B accepts A's compensation offer,
   binding A's compensation promise
2. **Escrow activation**: When collateral reserves are committed to
   the request
3. **Reputation staking**: When refusal would damage A's credibility
   in reputation-sensitive contexts
These transformations always maintain autonomy—B never becomes
obligated to fulfill the request—while creating collateralized
commitments from A[1][13][26].

## Economic and Failure Implications

### Value Transfer as Promise Foundation

Compensation embodies **economic promise structures** within requests.
When Agent A offers payment for services, that offer constitutes a
promise of value transfer—a commitment about A's own resource
allocation. Upon B's acceptance, this becomes a binding pledge
enforceable through:
- Reputation systems tracking payment history
- Escrow mechanisms securing funds
- Smart contracts automating distribution
The compensation promise operates independently from the request's
core imposition, functioning as a self-contained commitment about A's
future resource behavior[8][13][20].

### Failure Consequence Asymmetry

Broken promises and unfulfilled requests incur divergent reputational
penalties:
- **Promise failures**: Directly damage promiser's trust capital
  through measurable reliability metrics
- **Request rejections**: Minimally impact requester credibility,
  primarily affecting future request receptiveness
- **Embedded promise failures**: Damage only the promise-maker (e.g.,
  broken compensation promises impact payer, not service provider)
This asymmetric impact reinforces the autonomy principle—only
self-generated commitments carry accountability weight[1][5][12].

## Protocol Implementation Guidelines

### Message Structure Specifications

Effective systems separate request, promise, and hybrid messages:
```json
// Pure Request (No Commitment)
{
  "type": "request",
  "initiator": "AgentA",
  "target": "AgentB",
  "action": "provideResourceX",
  "compensation": null
}

// Embedded Promise Request
{
  "type": "bid_request",
  "initiator": "AgentA",
  "target": "AgentB",
  "action": "provideResourceX",
  "compensation": {
    "type": "promise",
    "resource": "currencyY",
    "conditions": "uponDelivery"
  }
}

// Pure Promise
{
  "type": "promise",
  "promiser": "AgentA",
  "scope": "public",
  "commitment": "availability:9am-5pm_EST"
}
```
This schema maintains clear ontological boundaries while enabling
hybrid structures where needed[7][15][16].

### Authority and Delegation Boundaries

Critically, requests cannot delegate promise-making authority under
autonomy principles. When Agent A requests Agent B to "promise
Resource Z to Agent C", B remains autonomously empowered to:
- Reject the imposition entirely
- Make an independent promise to C (voluntarily)
- Counter-offer alternative terms
This prevents chains of imposed obligations, ensuring all commitments
originate from the committing agent's voluntary intent[4][12][26].

## Conclusion: Asymmetric Relationship with Embedded Bridges

Requests and promises maintain fundamental distinctions in autonomy
adherence, directionality, and accountability structures. A request is
never intrinsically a promise—it is an imposition attempting to
influence others' behavior. However, requests can contain embedded
promises regarding the requester's own future actions, particularly in
compensation scenarios. These embedded commitments become binding
only when accepted by the recipient, preserving the autonomy of both
parties. This nuanced relationship enables flexible cooperation while
maintaining Promise Theory's core principle: all commitments remain
voluntary declarations about an agent's own future behavior[1][3][4].
