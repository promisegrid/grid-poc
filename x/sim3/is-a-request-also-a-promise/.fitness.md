- 100 Correctly applies Promise Theory's core tenets: distinguishes requests as impositions (attempts to influence others) from promises as voluntary commitments about one's own future behavior
- 95 Explicitly addresses compensation-offer scenarios: analyzes how BID-type requests contain embedded promises (e.g., compensation offers become promissory commitments) while maintaining request/promise distinction
- 90 Maintains autonomy principle: never frames requests as binding obligations, preserving agents' freedom to accept/reject requests without commitment
- 85 Explains contextual transformation: details specific conditions where requests morph into promises (e.g., compensation acceptance creates collateralized commitments)
- 80 Incorporates assessment mechanisms: specifies how promise-tracking applies to request-embedded commitments (e.g., compensation promise fulfillment status)
- 75 Distinguishes directionality: shows requests initiate negotiation (bidirectional) vs. promises establish unilateral commitments
- 70 Uses Burgess' "voluntary cooperation" framework: positions requests as influence attempts and promises as self-commitments
- 65 Addresses economic dimensions: analyzes compensation offers as value-transfer promises within request structures
- 60 Contrasts failure consequences: differentiates reputation impacts of broken promises vs. rejected/unfulfilled requests
- 55 Demonstrates protocol implementation: suggests message structures distinguishing requests, embedded promises, and pure promises
- 50 Examines authority dynamics: explains why requests can't delegate promise-making authority under autonomy principle
