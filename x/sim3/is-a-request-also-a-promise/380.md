### Ontological Separation Argument

This position maintains that requests and promises occupy **distinct
linguistic categories** in agent communication. A promise constitutes
a self-referential commitment ("I will do X"), while a request
represents an other-directed petition ("Will you do Y?"). This
distinction manifests in protocol design through divergent
accountability structures and failure states[1][3].

### Computational Implementation Evidence

Practical implementations reveal operational distinctions:
- **Promises** require resource reservation (e.g., escrow mechanisms)
- **Requests** utilize discovery protocols (e.g., service locators)
- **Promise breaches** trigger penalty enforcement algorithms
- **Request rejections** initiate alternative path discovery[3][4]

Automated Market Makers (AMMs) illustrate this distinction: liquidity
providers make resource promises (deposited assets), while traders
initiate swap requests without pre-commitment[4]. This separation
enables efficient resource allocation while maintaining clear
accountability boundaries[4].
