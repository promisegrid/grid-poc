# Position Paper: Carol's Perspective on a Git-Repo-Like Worldline Model

## Introduction

I advocate for a worldline model where events are organized similarly to a
Git repository. Here, each event is like a file, and its naming or order
reflects the sequence of events. This produces an intuitive framework that
aligns with well-known version control paradigms.

## The Git-Repo-Like Model for Worldlines

In this model, every event becomes an individual "file" in a repository.
Files are ordered chronologically, simplifying event tracking, retrieval,
and historical comparisons without heavy verification overhead.

### Key Characteristics

- **Chronological File Ordering:**  
  Events stored as separate files in strict chronological order make it
  effortless to review history.

- **Simplicity and Familiarity:**  
  The Git metaphor leverages familiar concepts such as commits, diffs, and
  branches, easing system interaction for developers.

- **Versioning and History Management:**  
  Inherent support for branching, merging, and diffing facilitates
  clear management of parallel event streams.

## Advantages Over Alternative Models

- **Ease of Implementation:**  
  Using structure analogous to Git brings established, optimized tools
  to our system, simplifying operations like checkouts and commits.

- **Transparency:**  
  Just as Git records each change, our model provides full transparency
  over the historical event stream, invaluable for debugging and auditing.

- **Intuitive User Experience:**  
  Familiar version control workflows reduce the learning curve among
  developers and system administrators.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Scalability Issues:**  
  While straightforward in design, managing very high volumes of events may
  require advanced techniques such as repository sharding or snapshotting.

- **Complex Merging Logic:**  
  As with Git, resolving merge conflicts in divergent event streams will
  require robust conflict resolution strategies.

- **Event Granularity:**  
  Balancing the size of each event “file” is critical; too fine or too coarse
  granularity can impact the fidelity and efficiency of the history.

## Conclusion

A Git-repository-inspired model offers a balanced blend of simplicity and
transparency. It makes the event sequence easy to understand and manage,
while still allowing for sophisticated historical reconstruction.

## Future Directions

To push our model ahead, I propose:
- **User Feedback Integration:**  
  Incorporate feedback to fine-tune the balance between simplicity and
  technical complexity.
- **Scalability Trials:**  
  Test and optimize the model to handle high-volume scenarios.
- **Enhanced Merge Operations:**  
  Develop dedicated tools for managing merge conflicts in multi-worldline
  edits.
