# Position Paper: Carol's Perspective on a Git-Repo-Like Worldline Model

## Introduction

I advocate for a worldline model where events are organized similarly to a
Git repository. Here, each event is like a file, and its naming 
reflects the sequence of events. This produces an intuitive framework that
aligns with well-known version control paradigms.

## The Git-Repo-Like Model for Worldlines

In this model, every event becomes an individual "file" in a repository.
Files are named chronologically, simplifying event tracking, retrieval,
and historical comparisons without heavy verification overhead.

### Key Characteristics

- **Simplicity and Familiarity:**  
  The Git metaphor leverages familiar concepts such as commits, diffs, and
  branches, easing system interaction for developers.

- **Versioning and History Management:**  
  support for branching, merging, and diffing facilitates
  clear management of parallel event streams.

## Advantages Over Alternative Models

- **Ease of Implementation:**  
  Using structure analogous to Git brings established mental models
  to our system, simplifying developer workload.

- **Intuitive User Experience:**  
  Familiar version control concepts reduce the learning curve among
  developers and system administrators.

## Challenges & Considerations

merging and branching operations are similar in concept to Git, but
in our case we can also make use of LLMs to assist with merges.

## Conclusion

A Git-repository-inspired model offers a balanced blend of simplicity and
transparency. It makes the event sequence easy to understand and manage,
while still allowing for sophisticated historical reconstruction.

## Future Directions

- **User Feedback Integration:**  
- **Scalability Trials:**  
  Test and optimize the model to handle high-volume scenarios.
- **Enhanced Merge Operations:**  
  Develop dedicated tools for managing merge conflicts in multi-worldline
  edits.
