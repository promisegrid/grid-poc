# Gail's Discussion Script: Project Overview and Goal

Hello everyone,

I’d like to share my understanding of the overall goal of our project. Our vision is to build a decentralized, consensus-based messaging and governance system that leverages Promise Theory to ensure trust, audibility, and resilience across distributed agents. Here’s what that means in practical terms:

## Decentralized Trust and Governance:

Every agent operates autonomously, making Burgess-style promises solely about its own behavior. Each message acts like a DAG edit operation—a promise that asserts the validity of modifications to one or more worldlines. This approach moves us beyond mere requests for action, ensuring that every change is a verifiable commitment.

## Immutable and Replayable Worldlines:

Replaying the sequence of messages allows us to reconstruct the worldline(s) at any point in time. By maintaining a consistent history of events, we can ensure the integrity of the system and provide a transparent audit trail for all participants.

## Unified Communication and Computation:

PromiseGrid (our project) blends secure messaging with decentralized computing. The system is designed so that messages are not only data carriers but also functional promises. Each signed message increases confidence in governance, promoting a robust infrastructure for both collaborative work and decision-making.

## Scalability, Resilience, and Collaborative Innovation:

The end goal is a system that not only scales to support a diverse range of agents but also provides transparent governance and a verifiable history of actions. This lays a strong foundation for collaborative environments, where decentralized decision-making and autonomous control are paramount.

## Preventing Tragedy of the Commons:

By using a decentralized system, we can prevent the tragedy of the commons by ensuring that every agent is accountable for its actions. This approach promotes transparency and trust among all participants, reducing the risk of malicious behavior and ensuring that the system remains robust and secure.

## Next Steps:

Are there any additional goals that need to be added to this overview? 

Best regards,  
Gail
