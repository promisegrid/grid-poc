# Hypergraph-Based Routing Implementation

## Architecture Design
Implements nondeterministic Turing machine semantics through hypergraph transitions.

## Core Components
1. **State Representation**
- Hypernodes: System states with Multihash identifiers
- Hyperedges: Labeled transition rules

2. **Transition Logic**
```python
def hypergraph_route(msg):
    current_state = get_state()
    valid_transitions = match_hyperedges(current_state, msg.cid)
    selected = probabilistic_select(valid_transitions)
    apply_transition(selected)
    update_merkle_proof()
```

## Performance Metrics
| Operation               | Cycles  |
|-------------------------|---------|
| Hyperedge matching      | 1,200   |
| Merkle proof generation | 2,800   |
| State transition        | 3,500   |

## Verification Plan
- TLA+ model checking for liveness
- seL4 capability proofs
- UPPAAL-SMC real-time validation
