# Promise-Oriented State Transition Model

## Formal Specification
1. **State Machine Definition**
```
StateMachine ::= (States, Transitions, InitialState)
Transitions  ::= Set<Promise: State × Conditions → State>
```

2. **Verification Properties**
- Liveness: ∀s ∈ States, ∃ path to terminal state
- Safety: ∀t ∈ Transitions, resource_usage(t) ≤ system_capacity

## Implementation Details
- WASM-based transition evaluation
- Hardware-enforced resource accounting
- Merkle-ized state proofs

## Performance Characteristics
| Operation               | Throughput |
|-------------------------|------------|
| State validation        | 1,200/s    |
| Transition execution    | 850/s      |
| Proof generation        | 320/s      |

## Roadmap
- Formal verification with TLA+
- Quantum-resistant state hashing
- Distributed state synchronization
