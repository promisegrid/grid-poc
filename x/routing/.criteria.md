# PromiseGrid Message and Routing Proposals Fitness Criteria

- 95 Decentralized architecture enabling user-owned nodes and organic
  network growth without centralized control
- 90 Capability-based security model implementing fine-grained access
  control through cryptographic promises and tokens
- 85 Content-addressable code storage using multihash format for
  immutable, platform-agnostic execution environments
- 80 Merge-as-consensus conflict resolution mechanism enabling
  application-specific document merging strategies
- 75 Cross-platform compatibility supporting execution from IoT to browser
  tabs to bare-metal servers via multiple sandbox technologies
- 70 Computational governance exposing consensus mechanisms as system
  calls for organizational decision-making
- 65 Decentralized cache implementation with referentially transparent
  function response storage and replication
- 60 Universal protocol design allowing nested message passing and
  hyperkernel routing extensibility
- 55 Community-driven development model with open participation in
  protocol evolution and tooling creation
- 50 Integration with prior technologies including WASM, container
  orchestration, and infrastructure-as-code principles
