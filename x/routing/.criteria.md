# PromiseGrid Message and Routing Proposals Fitness Criteria

You are a genetic algorithm fitness function.  

Rank and discuss the pros and cons of various proposals for the
PromiseGrid message format and routing algorithm.  

Imagine what it would look like if routing were via some sort of mesh
of promises between agents rather than a DHT.  In other words,
overcome the limitations of DHTs by in some way tracking a peer's
promise to route to a given CID or DID versus whether they were able
to keep or break that promise.  For this to work while keeping the
kernel as simple as possible, the kernal itself would need to be able
to be contacted by agents, either via messages or via some host
functions, such that higher-level routing logic can be implemented by
the agents themselves.

The message format looks something like this:

type Message struct {
  Tag    struct {
    Number uint64 // = 0x67726964 = 'grid' as 4-byte big-endian integer
    Content struct {
      // CIDs, DIDs, topics, or Mach-like port(s) used by the kernel to
      // quickly route the message to the correct agent(s)
      Topics [][]byte  
      // Message payload -- payload layer contains any signatures,
      // bid/ask semantics, resource allocation semantics, etc. 
      Payload  []byte  
    }
}

This pushes higher-level intelligence and security operations into the
agents; agents subscribe to CIDs, topics, or port numbers.  All the
PromiseGrid kernel needs to do is to route the message to the correct
agent based on the information it's getting from higher-level
agents.  

Here are some of the criteria you must use to score fitness, each
preceeded by a points weight:

- 500 Move all possible message elements into the payload layer --
  keep the routing layer as simple as possible.  This requirement may
  override some of the other criteria.
- 500 Routing based on promise keep/break semantics rather than
  DHT-like routing.
- 450 Message format is simple and extensible 
- 400 Message format provides a means for the kernel to choose among
  multiple conflicting agents.
- 300 Router can be written in about one hundred lines of code.
- 150 Message headers contain only enough information to route the
  message to the correct agent
- 100 Proposal shows a Go struct for the message format
- 100 Proposal shows pseudocode for the algorithm used to route a
  message to an agent
- 100 Proposal shows the host functions that the PromiseGrid kernel
  needs to support for agents running in WASM runtimes
- 95 Decentralized architecture enabling user-owned nodes and organic
  network growth without centralized control
- 90 simple-enough routing that can be implemented by a tiny
  promisegrid kernel on an IoT device
- 90 Capability-based security model implementing fine-grained access
  control through cryptographic promises and tokens
- 85 Content-addressable code storage using multihash format for
  immutable, platform-agnostic execution environments
- 80 Message contains a signature from the promising agent (the author)
- 80 Merge-as-consensus conflict resolution mechanism enabling
  application-specific document merging strategies
- 75 Cross-platform compatibility supporting execution from IoT to browser
  tabs to bare-metal servers via multiple sandbox technologies
- 70 Computational governance exposing consensus mechanisms as system
  calls for organizational decision-making
- 65 Decentralized cache implementation with referentially transparent
  function response storage and replication
- 60 Integration with prior technologies including WASM, container
  orchestration, and infrastructure-as-code principles
- 60 Universal protocol design allowing nested message passing and
  hyperkernel routing extensibility
- 55 Community-driven development model with open participation in
  protocol evolution and tooling creation
- 30 bid/ask semantics at the network layer for
  routing and resource allocation
