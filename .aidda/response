Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to add a double-auction mechanism to PromiseGrid's routing.md file. The goal is to fairly allocate resources and prevent spam using personal currencies, without any blockchain or crypto elements. All routing is local, with nodes pricing cancellation risk into their bids/asks. Abusive nodes see their currency value drop, reducing their network participation.

Looking at the existing routing.md, there's a section on double auctions (item 58: Decentralized Double-Auction Routing Protocol). The user provided search results include several papers on double auctions in edge computing and resource allocation, which mention mechanisms for handling many-to-many assignments, network resource optimization, and truthfulness. The example scenario needs to involve Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave.

First, I should outline how the double auction works in this context. Each node acts as both a buyer and seller, using personal currencies. When a message needs to be routed, nodes submit bids (to forward) and asks (to accept). The auction matches these, considering cancellation risk. Intermediate nodes adjust their spreads based on reliability. Abusive nodes lose value in their currency, making others less likely to accept their bids.

For the example scenario: Alice wants to send a message to Dave via Bob and Carol. Each node sets their ask price based on their current load and trust. Bob's ask is lower due to good reputation, Carol's is higher because of higher risk. The auction matches the lowest asks, ensuring the message is routed efficiently. If Carol fails to forward, her currency value drops, affecting future transactions.

I need to integrate this into routing.md under a new protocol (maybe numbered 59). The example should show the steps of the auction, the currency adjustments, and the impact of failures. Also, ensure it's clear that nodes only interact with direct peers, maintaining local routing. Cite the relevant search results that support the mechanism's design, like [1] for network resource optimization and [3][4] for truthful mechanisms.

59. Decentralized Double-Auction Routing Protocol (D2ARP)  
    This protocol implements a peer-to-peer double auction mechanism where nodes bid using personal currencies to route messages while preventing spam through economic incentives. Intermediate nodes price cancellation risk into bid/ask spreads, creating self-regulating network participation.  

    **Protocol Mechanics**  
    1. **Order Book Structure**:  
       - Each node maintains localized bid/ask books for direct peers  
       - Asks represent minimum compensation to forward (in sender's currency)  
       - Bids specify maximum willingness to pay for next-hop routing  

    2. **Risk-Adjusted Pricing**:  
       ```go
       type AuctionOrder struct {
           NodeID     string // Peer identifier
           Currency   string // Personal currency ticker
           BidPrice   float64 // Max payment willing to offer
           AskPrice   float64 // Min compensation required 
           RiskFactor float64 // 0.0-1.0 based on reliability history
       }
       ```

    3. **Matching Algorithm**:  
       a. Sender broadcasts route request with max hop count  
       b. Intermediate nodes submit sealed asks considering:  
          - Current queue depth  
          - Historical fulfillment rate  
          - Currency exchange reputation  
       c. Path selection uses Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism to ensure truthfulness[1][3]  

    4. **Settlement & Reputation**:  
       - Successful forwards increase node's currency value  
       - Failed promises trigger automatic currency devaluation:  
         ```go
         func adjustReputation(node *Node, success bool) {
             if success {
                 node.CurrencyValue *= 1.05 // 5% appreciation
             } else {
                 node.CurrencyValue *= 0.80 // 20% depreciation
             }
         }
         ```

    **Example Scenario: Alice → Bob → Carol → Dave**  
    1. **Initial State**:  
       | Node  | Currency Value | Ask Price Base | Risk Factor |  
       |-------|----------------|----------------|-------------|  
       | Alice | 1.0 ALC        | N/A            | 0.10        |  
       | Bob   | 1.2 BOB        | 0.8 ALC        | 0.15        |  
       | Carol | 0.7 CRL        | 1.1 BOB        | 0.30        |  
       | Dave  | 1.5 DAV        | 0.9 CRL        | 0.05        |  

    2. **Auction Execution**:  
       a. Alice broadcasts route to Dave with max bid 2.0 ALC  
       b. Bob calculates risk-adjusted ask:  
          0.8 ALC * (1 + 0.15 risk) = 0.92 ALC  
       c. Carol computes cross-currency ask:  
          1.1 BOB * (BOB/ALC rate 1.2) = 1.32 ALC  
          1.32 ALC * (1 + 0.30 risk) = 1.72 ALC  
       d. Dave's ask converts to 0.9 CRL * (CRL/ALC rate 0.583) = 0.52 ALC  

    3. **Path Selection**:  
       | Hop  | Cumulative Cost | Risk-Adjusted Cost |  
       |------|-----------------|--------------------|  
       | Bob  | 0.92 ALC        | 0.92 * 1.15 = 1.06 |  
       | Carol| 1.72 ALC        | 1.72 * 1.30 = 2.24 |  
       | Dave | 0.52 ALC        | 0.52 * 1.05 = 0.55 |  

       System selects Bob → Dave path (total 1.06 + 0.55 = 1.61 ALC)  

    4. **Outcome**:  
       - Alice pays 1.61 ALC split between Bob (0.92) and Dave (0.69)  
       - Bob successfully forwards → BOB appreciates to 1.26  
       - Alternate route through Carol rejected due to high risk premium  

    5. **Failure Case**:  
       If Bob fails to forward:  
       - BOB devalues 20% → 1.0 BOB/ALC rate  
       - Future asks increase by 15-20% to compensate risk  
       - Network automatically routes through lower-risk nodes  

    This mechanism aligns economic incentives with reliable message forwarding while maintaining local-only interactions between peers[3][4]. The VCG-based matching prevents market manipulation and ensures participants reveal true costs[1][5].
