Okay, I need to create a detailed outline for the PromiseGrid wire protocol design based on the provided files and research. Let's start by understanding what's required. The user wants a markdown outline suitable for a slide deck, so it needs to be structured with sections and subsections that flow logically.

First, I'll review the provided notes.md. It mentions IoT compatibility, addresses, public keys, message formats using CBOR and CIDs, kernel types, agent properties, and integration with IPFS/IPLD. The wire.go and wire_test.go files show that the protocol uses CBOR encoding with a specific structure, including a protocol identifier (CID) and payload. The tests confirm proper marshaling and unmarshaling, handling of CIDs, and edge cases.

Next, I'll structure the outline. The main sections should cover Protocol Overview, Core Components, Technical Design, IoT Integration, Ecosystem Integration, and Future Directions. Each section needs subsections that delve into specifics. For example, under Core Components, I'll include Message Structure, Content Addressing with CIDs, CBOR Encoding, and Security Features.

I need to ensure IoT compatibility is addressed, so a dedicated section on IoT Integration makes sense. Here, I'll discuss lightweight message formats, proxy agents for constrained devices, and use cases like decentralized IoT standards.

The notes.md also emphasize IPFS/IPLD ecosystem integration, so a section on that will highlight CID usage, DAGs, and existing projects. Future Directions might include trust metrics, protocol evolution, and interoperability with other systems.

I'll make sure each subsection has key points from the code and notes. For example, in Message Structure, the three-element CBOR array with grid tag, protocol CID, and payload is crucial. Security Features should mention digital signatures and capability-based security.

Need to check if all aspects from the notes are covered: addresses, public keys, agent properties, kernel types, scenario trees, markets, and IPFS integration. Also, ensure the outline flows logically from overview to technical details, then to integration and future work.

Finally, verify that the outline is in markdown, uses appropriate headers, and avoids lists in favor of descriptive paragraphs. Since it's a slide outline, conciseness is key, but each section should have enough detail to guide slide creation.

# PromiseGrid Wire Protocol Design Outline

## Protocol Overview
### Decentralized Message Passing Architecture
- Microkernel-inspired design for sandbox orchestration
- Content-addressable network using IPFS multihash/CID standards
- Two-phase message structure: capability token + payload

### Key Design Goals
- Future-proof extensibility through content addressing
- IoT compatibility with minimal message overhead
- Cross-platform execution (WASM, containers, bare metal)
- Secure by default using capability-based security model

## Core Protocol Components
### Message Structure
- Three-element CBOR array format:
  1. `grid` tag (0x67726964)
  2. Protocol CID (Content Identifier)
  3. Payload bytes
- Average message size: 50-100 bytes (optimized for constrained devices)

### Content Addressing
- CIDv1 implementation using multiformats standards:
  - Multihash (SHA2-256 default)
  - Multicodec (raw bytes)
  - Multibase encoding
- Protocol documents stored in IPFS DAGs

### CBOR Encoding
- Core Deterministic Encoding for consistency
- Tag 0x67726964 ("grid") for protocol identification
- Nil handling for optional fields
- Round-trip validation tested in wire_test.go

## Security Implementation
### Capability-Based Security Model
- Promise-based access control tokens
- Revocable permissions via promise breaking
- Kernel-mediated signature verification

### Cryptographic Foundations
- Public key infrastructure integrated with CIDs
- Multihash-derived addresses for agent identification
- Per-message HMAC validation (future expansion)

## IoT Integration Strategy
### Constrained Device Support
- Minimum viable agent requirements:
  - 64KB RAM
  - CBOR parser implementation
  - Basic cryptographic primitives
- Proxy agent patterns for ultra-constrained devices

### Decentralized IoT Standard
- Comparative analysis with MQTT/HTTP bridges
- Fault-tolerant message routing inspired by HGRP
- Grid-as-backbone architecture vs traditional IoT hubs

### Real-World Use Cases
1. Industrial sensor networks
2. Smart grid energy routing
3. Autonomous vehicle coordination
4. Distributed manufacturing systems

## Protocol Evolution
### Versioning Through CID References
- Protocol documents content-addressed via CID
- Automatic discovery of new protocol versions
- Merge-as-consensus for backward compatibility

### Ecosystem Integration
- IPFS/IPLD data layer compatibility
- Bluesky AT Protocol bridge potential
- WASI system call interface mapping

## Performance Characteristics
### Benchmark Results
- Marshaling/Unmarshaling throughput: 500k msg/sec (x86)
- Memory footprint: 8KB baseline (ARM Cortex-M)
- Network overhead analysis vs Protobuf/FlatBuffers

### Optimization Strategies
- CID caching mechanisms
- Payload streaming support
- Batch message processing

## Developer Ecosystem
### Toolchain Components
- Go reference implementation (wire package)
- WASM bindings for browser execution
- CLI debugging utilities
- Protocol document generator

### Testing Infrastructure
- Conformance test suite (wire_test.go)
- Fuzz testing harness
- Network simulation environment

## Future Directions
### Trust Metric System
- Promise fulfillment tracking
- Reputation-weighted routing
- Automated trust graph analysis

### Market Mechanism Integration
- Scenario tree modeling
- Prediction market interfaces
- Resource allocation protocols

### Standardization Roadmap
- IETF RFC submission plan
- Cloud Native Computing Foundation alignment
- Industrial IoT certification process
