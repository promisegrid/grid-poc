Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to update their protocol documentation and test cases to incorporate Merkle DAGs and decision trees with proper CID handling, probability math, and trust metrics. 

First, I need to understand the existing files. In wire.md, the example CBOR structures use string CIDs, but the user noted they should be binary. The DAG-CBOR spec requires map keys to be strings, so full CID strings are necessary there. However, links in other positions should use CBOR tag 42 with binary CIDs. The nested list structure for the decision tree might not be ideal for a DAG. Using maps with parent/child links would better represent multiple parents. The probability math in the trust calculation is subtracting predicted from actual, which can lead to negative trust. The user wants absolute differences instead.

Looking at the search results, Merkle DAGs allow nodes to reference multiple parents and children, which is key for representing worldlines [1][6]. Decision trees can be encoded in DAGs by allowing nodes to have multiple parents where branches converge [9][13]. Using fixed-point integers for probabilities ensures deterministic encoding, as floating points can vary [3][8].

For the COSE envelope, the payload's "tree" field refers to a CID, which should be a binary CID with tag 42. The nested decision tree example in wire.md uses lists, but a DAG structure would require nodes to reference parents and children via CIDs. Each node should have "parents" and "children" arrays, with children including probability and weight. The trust calculation should multiply the weight by (1 - absolute difference between actual and predicted) to keep trust positive.

In wire-test.md, the test cases need to check for correct CID usage: full strings as map keys, binary with tag 42 elsewhere. The probability validation should ensure sums are 1000 in fixed-point. The trust tests must verify absolute differences and weight application.

I'll restructure the decision tree example in wire.md to use a DAG-CBOR node format with parent/child links, binary CIDs, and fixed-point probabilities. The COSE example will be updated to use binary CIDs where appropriate. The trust calculation in Python will be corrected to use absolute differences and fixed-point math. In wire-test.md, I'll adjust the test cases to reflect these changes, ensuring CID formats, probability sums, and trust metrics are properly validated.

# PromiseGrid Wire Protocol Specification

This specification document defines the PromiseGrid wire protocol, leveraging CBOR, COSE, IPLD/DAG-CBOR and Merkle DAGs to securely transmit signed assertions of probabilistic state transitions. The protocol models an infinite state machine as a Merkle Decision DAG where nodes contain probability/weight metadata and may have multiple parent/child relationships.

## 1. Introduction

PromiseGrid enables decentralized agents to make conditional promises through a Merkle Decision DAG structure that combines properties of decision trees and content-addressed graphs. Each node contains:

1. Event/state content addressed via CIDv1
2. Probability distribution over child nodes
3. Weight multiplier for trust computation
4. Links to multiple parent/child nodes as Merkle edges

This structure enables:
- Partial traversal without full tree parsing
- Probabilistic trust calculations
- Immutable content addressing via Merkle links
- Efficient branching factor updates

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Merkle Decision DAGs

Combining Merkle DAGs [6] with decision tree concepts [5], a Merkle Decision DAG:
- Uses CIDv1 for all node references
- Allows nodes with multiple parents (acyclic)
- Encodes probability/weight metadata at edges
- Permits partial traversal via content addressing
- Enables CRDT-like convergence through hash-linked structure [7]

### 2.2 DAG-CBOR Constraints

Key protocol constraints:
- Map keys must be text strings (full CID strings)
- Links use CBOR tag 42 for binary CIDs
- Floating-point values prohibited; probabilities use fixed-point
- Deterministic encoding required for consistent hashing

## 3. Protocol Message Design

### 3.1 Node Structure

Each node is encoded as DAG-CBOR:

```cbor
{
  "parents": [42(h...) ...],      # Binary CID links (tag 42)
  "children": [
    {
      "prob": 650,                # Fixed-point probability (650 = 0.65)
      "weight": 1200,             # Integer weight (x1000)
      "child": 42(h...)           # Child node CID
    },
    ...
  ],
  "content": "bafyrei..."         # Content CID (full string)
}
```

- Probabilities sum to 1000 (fixed-point representation)
- Weight multipliers apply to subtree probabilities
- Parents allow multiple antecedents in DAG structure

### 3.2 COSE-Sign1 Envelope

Messages wrap nodes in cryptographically signed envelopes:

```cbor
COSE_Sign1(
  protected: <<{
    1: -7,                        # ES256 algorithm
    15: {                         # CWT Claims
      "iss": 42(h...)             # Issuer node CID
    }
  }>>,
  payload: <<{
    "node": 42(h...),             # Binary CID of node content
    "parents": [42(h...) ...],    # Parent node updates
    "pinning": {
      "commit": "bafyrei..."      # Full CID string
    }
  }>>,
  signature: h'3045...'
)
```

## 4. Trust Metric Computation

Trust updates use observed vs predicted outcomes:

```python
def evaluate_trust(path):
    trust = 1.0
    for node in path:
        actual = node['actual']     # Observed outcome (0.0-1.0)
        predicted = node['prob'] / 1000.0
        trust *= node['weight']/1000.0 * (1 - abs(actual - predicted))
    return trust
```

Key differences from prior approach:
- Uses absolute difference to prevent negative trust
- Fixed-point integer math for determinism
- Weights applied multiplicatively to path trust

## 5. Validation & Compliance

### 5.1 Structural Validation
- All CIDs validate as proper CIDv1 with identity multibase
- Probability sums equal 1000 ± tolerance per node
- No cyclic references in parent/child links

### 5.2 Cryptographic Validation
- COSE signatures verify against issuer keys
- Payload hashes match node CIDs
- Parent links resolve to valid existing nodes
