Okay, I need to add comments to the provided Go code for the IPFS-Lite node. Let me start by understanding what each part does.

First, the package declaration and the initial comment. The existing comment mentions it's an example, so I'll expand that to explain the overall purpose.

Looking at the imports, they're necessary for context, IO, IPFS-Lite, CID, crypto, multiaddr, etc. No changes needed there.

In the main function, the context is set up with cancellation. I'll add a comment explaining that it's for managing the lifecycle.

The in-memory datastore is created using ipfslite.NewInMemoryDatastore(). A comment here can note that it's ephemeral, which is good for testing.

Generating the RSA key pair: the code uses crypto.GenerateKeyPair. I should explain that this is for the peer's identity.

The listen address is created with multiaddr.NewMultiaddr. A comment here can mention that it's setting the listener to all interfaces on TCP 4005.

Setting up libp2p with SetupLibp2p. The parameters include the context, private key, listen addresses, etc. A comment here can outline the components being initialized, like the host and DHT.

Error handling after SetupLibp2p and New: adding comments to note where panics occur due to setup failures.

Creating the IPFS-Lite node with ipfslite.New. A comment here can explain the parameters and that the node is initialized with the host and DHT.

Bootstrap connects to default peers. Adding a comment about joining the IPFS network.

Decoding the CID for "Hello World". The CID is hardcoded, so a comment can mention that it's a known test CID.

Fetching the file using lite.GetFile. Comments here can explain the retrieval process and the use of io.ReadAll to read the content.

Finally, printing the content. A comment to note the expected output.

I need to make sure comments are concise, explain each major step, and don't repeat what's obvious from the code. Also, check that comments are accurate, especially regarding IPFS-Lite and libp2p usage. Ensure that no deprecated functions are mentioned and that all comments add value without being redundant.
