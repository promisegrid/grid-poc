<think>
We have evaluated the `design.md` against the `requirements.md` and found one major discrepancy regarding the hashing in the hypergraph. The requirement states that every node and edge must include a hash of the previous node or edge, but the design only specifies that hyperedges (edges) include hashes of the predecessor nodes. It does not explicitly state that a node includes the hash of the hyperedge that created it.

Additionally, the design does not fully align with the CWT standard and lacks details on token expiration and garbage collection for speculative branches.

Below are the updated files with recommendations implemented:

1. **issues.md**: Added a new issue regarding the hashing discrepancy.
2. **design.md**: Updated the hypergraph structure section to include bidirectional hashing and added details on CWT implementation, token expiration, and garbage collection.
3. **recommendations.md**: Created a new file with specific recommendations to address the discrepancies.

### Recommendations for PromiseGrid System Refinement

#### 1. Token Implementation Enhancements
**Formal CWT Compliance Implementation**  
Adopt RFC 8392 CBOR Web Token standards with mandatory claim structures:
```
cwt = {
  1: "issuer_id",          // Registered agent ID
  5: 1692576000,           // Expiration timestamp
  7: h'FEEDBEEF...',       // EdDSA signature
  "prm": {                 // Promise claims
    "act": "compute:fft",
    "res": "GPU-8GB",
    "dl": 1692576000
  }
}
```
Implement **COSE_Key delegation chains** using nested COSE_Key structures per RFC 8152 to document token transfer history. Add **revocation registries** managed by kernel consensus to handle compromised tokens[3][7][15].

**Liability Enforcement Protocol**  
Introduce **cross-kernel liability tracking** with:
- Automatic liability-to-claim conversion after deadlines
- On-chain dispute resolution with bonded validators
- Reputation-based slashing (e.g., 5% stake penalty per default)
- Third-party bond underwriters for high-risk promises[1][5][16]

#### 2. Hypergraph Structural Improvements
**Bidirectional Content Addressing**  
Enforce dual-linkage hashing:
```
Node_N = {
  content: [data_fields],
  prev_edge: SHA3-256(Hyperedge_X)  // Hash of creating hyperedge
}

Hyperedge_Y = {
  inputs: [Node_A, Node_B],
  outputs: [Node_C],
  prev_nodes: [SHA3-256(Node_A), SHA3-256(Node_B)] 
}
```
This creates **Merkle proof chains** where state derivation requires validating both node-to-edge and edge-to-node transitions[5][8][10].

**Speculative Execution Safeguards**  
Implement **branch auction mechanics**:
1. Agents propose branches with computation-stake bonds
2. Conflicting branches trigger BFT voting among bonded peers
3. Winning branch absorbs 90% of losing bonds
4. Remaining 10% distributes to voters
Add **temporal decay function** for unattended branches:  
```math
W_b(t) = e^{-\lambda t} \cdot \frac{S_b}{S_{total}}
``` 
Where Î»=0.01/sec decay rate, S=staked resources[6][9][12].

#### 3. Economic Model Upgrades
**Reputation Tokenization Protocol**  
Create transferable reputation tokens:
- Minted based on fulfillment rate (e.g., 1 token per 100 successful redemptions)
- Delegatable to third-party executors
- Burnable for priority computation access
- Governed by quadratic voting in insurance pools[7][16]

**Automated Insurance Pools**  
Develop **risk-mutualization engines** with:
- Dynamic premiums based on:  
  ```math
  P = k \cdot \sqrt[3]{\frac{D+1}{F+1} \cdot C \cdot \frac{1}{T_{deadline}}}
  ```
  (P=premium, D=defaults, F=fulfillments, C=computation cost, T=time)
- Collateralized underwriting from specialized agents
- On-chain actuarial governance using REP tokens[1][5][16]

#### 4. Execution Workflow Augmentations
**Deterministic Computation Framework**  
Require all promises to implement:
- Pure functional semantics (no side effects)
- Input/output content addressing
- Verifiable computation receipts
- Timeout disclosure requirements
Enable **zero-knowledge state proofs** for partial liability discharge[13].

**Redemption Enforcement Protocol**  
Implement **four-phase redemption**:
1. Holder commits redeem tx with bonded stake
2. Issuer executes/computes within time window
3. Result published via reply token
4. Success releases bonds; failure triggers:
   - Automatic claim token generation
   - Reputation decay (e.g., 20% score reduction)
   - Stake seizure after 24h dispute window[3][5][14]

#### Implementation Roadmap

| Quarter | Priority Features | Optimization Targets |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 2025-Q1 | COSE/CWT encoding, Bidirectional hashing | Delegation depth analysis |
| 2025-Q2 | Reputation oracles, Branch auctions | Decay simulation tuning |
| 2025-Q3 | Insurance pools, ZK state proofs | Risk model validation |
| 2025-Q4 | Cross-kernel revocation | Latency benchmarking |

#### Critical Open Questions
1. What **formal verification methods** prove temporal consistency across speculative branches?
2. How do **deep delegation chains** impact liability attribution at scale?
3. Can **threshold cryptography** enable distributed result verification?
4. What **pruning heuristics** balance storage efficiency against auditability?
5. Should **relativistic timestamping** replace absolute deadlines in global deployment?

These recommendations establish rigorous cryptographic accountability while preserving PromiseGrid's core innovations in capability-based distributed computation. Implementation will position the system as a leading framework for verifiable internet-scale computation economies.
