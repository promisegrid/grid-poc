Okay, let me tackle this problem. The user wants to modify the routing.md file in their project to include a multi-hop routing protocol using a double-auction mechanism with personal currencies. They provided a bunch of search results that discuss various auction-based routing mechanisms, P2P systems, and related concepts.

First, I need to understand what the existing routing.md contains. The current file has a bunch of routing protocol ideas, numbered up to 76. The user wants to add a new section, specifically protocol 77, which integrates a double-auction system for fair resource allocation and spam prevention. They also want an example scenario with Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave.

Looking at the search results, several papers discuss double auctions in edge computing, P2P networks, and resource allocation. For example, Chen et al. (2022) propose a double auction mechanism for MEC services considering spectrum and routing. Another paper by Thakur et al. uses blockchain for distributed double auctions in energy trade, promoting local transactions. These can inform the protocol design.

The user's personalization note mentions using Go, avoiding dependencies, and keeping lines under 70 characters. The new protocol in routing.md should be concise and follow the existing structure. The example scenario needs to show how the auction works with personal currencies, probably involving bidding and settling payments through smart contracts.

I'll start by drafting protocol 77. It should outline the double-auction process, personal currencies as the medium, local routing, and prevention of spam by requiring bids. The example scenario will illustrate Alice wanting to send a message via Bob and Carol, who participate in the auction. The settlement would use each participant's personal currency, tracked through smart contracts.

I need to ensure that the code examples are in Go, using the appropriate syntax and line-wrapping. The example should show the message structure, bids, smart contract interactions, and settlement. Also, citations from the provided search results should be included where relevant, using the correct indices.

Now, putting it all together, the new section in routing.md will be protocol 77, followed by the example scenario. The code snippets will demonstrate the auction process and smart contract handling. All lines must be wrapped at 70 characters, and the Markdown formatting should be consistent with the existing document.

77. Decentralized Double-Auction Routing Protocol (D2ARP)
    This protocol implements a peer-to-peer double auction mechanism where
    nodes bid using personal currencies to route messages while preventing spam
    through economic incentives. Key features:
    
    - **Local auction markets**: Each node maintains an order book of bids/asks
      from direct peers only [1][2]
    - **Multi-hop execution**: Messages carry chained smart contracts that
      settle payments atomically across hops [3][4]
    - **Spam prevention**: Minimum bid requirements proportional to hop count
      and message size [5][6]
    
    Protocol Workflow:
    1. Sender publishes message with max bid in personal currency
    2. Intermediate nodes submit asks considering:
       - Current load
       - Path reliability
       - Exchange rates between currencies [7][8]
    3. Matching engine selects lowest-cost path meeting QoS constraints
    4. Smart contracts lock collateral until delivery confirmation [9][10]
    
    Example Alice->Dave via Bob->Carol:
    ```go
    // Message structure with auction parameters
    type AuctionMessage struct {
        ID        CID
        Sender    Address
        Recipient Address 
        MaxBid    map[Currency]float64 // Alice's ABC tokens
        Hops      []AuctionContract
    }

    // Intermediate node bid
    func (b *Bob) SubmitAsk(msg AuctionMessage) {
        askPrice := calculateCost(msg.Size, b.Load) 
        conversionRate := getExchangeRate("ABC", "BOB")
        convertedAsk := askPrice * conversionRate
        if convertedAsk <= msg.MaxBid["ABC"] {
            msg.Hops = append(msg.Hops, AuctionContract{
                Node:    b.Address,
                Ask:     convertedAsk,
                Currency: "BOB",
                Nonce:   generateNonce(),
            })
            forwardToNextHop(msg)
        }
    }

    // Smart contract settlement
    func settlePayments(hops []AuctionContract) {
        for _, contract := range hops {
            transferTokens(
                contract.Node,
                contract.Currency, 
                contract.Ask,
                contract.Nonce
            )
        }
    }
    ```
    This design enables: 
    - Localized price discovery without global coordination [11][12]
    - Resistance to spam through cryptographic payment enforcement [13][14]
    - Automatic load balancing via market incentives [15][16]
