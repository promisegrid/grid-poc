# Gail's Discussion Script: Project Overview and Goal

Hello everyone,

I’d like to share my understanding of the overall goal of our project. Our vision is to build a decentralized, consensus-based messaging and governance system that leverages Promise Theory to ensure trust, audibility, and resilience across distributed agents. Here’s what that means in practical terms:

- **Decentralized Trust and Governance:**  
  Every agent operates autonomously, making Burgess-style promises solely about its own behavior. Each message acts as a DAG edit operation—a promise that asserts the validity of modifications to one or more worldlines. This approach moves us beyond mere requests for action, ensuring that every change is a verifiable commitment.

- **Immutable and Replayable Worldlines:**  
  By organizing events as a Merkle DAG, our system protects the historical integrity of the data. Internal nodes capture hash chains that allow us to replay messages, reliably reconstructing the state of each worldline at any point in time. This supports seamless branching and merging while guaranteeing that every transition remains auditable.

- **Unified Communication and Computation:**  
  Drawing inspiration from PromiseGrid, our project blends secure messaging with decentralized computing. The system is designed so that messages are not only data carriers but also functional promises. Each signed message (or event) increases confidence in the overall state and governance of the network, promoting a robust infrastructure for both collaborative work and decision-making.

- **Consistent Edit and Query Framework:**  
  We support a single, expressive language for editing, querying, and subscribing to changes within the DAG. Each message contains one or more promises expressed as CWT claims. This ensures that operations—whether inserting, deleting, or reordering events—are dependable and that the system remains coherent, even when handling complex multi-worldline edits.

- **Scalability, Resilience, and Collaborative Innovation:**  
  The end goal is a system that not only scales to support a diverse range of agents but also provides transparent governance and a verifiable history of actions. This lays a strong foundation for collaborative environments, where decentralized decision-making and autonomous control are paramount.

In summary, our overall goal is to create a secure, auditable, and replayable messaging system that underpins a decentralized computing platform. By integrating cryptographic integrity, verifiable promise-based operations, and the flexible management of worldlines, we aim to revolutionize how distributed systems achieve consensus and governance.

Best regards,  
Gail
