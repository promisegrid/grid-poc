Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to write a proposal for using a CID list as a LISP-like language that the PromiseGrid kernel routers execute to route messages. They provided a lot of context, including search results and previous discussions about CID, routing, hypergraphs, and formal verification methods. 

First, I need to understand what a CID is. From the search results, CIDv1 is a content identifier in IPFS, which includes a multibase prefix, version, multicodec identifier, and multihash. It's used to uniquely identify content in a decentralized system. The CID list would be a sequence of these identifiers that the kernel uses to route messages.

The user mentioned LISP-like language, which probably refers to the Lisp programming language's syntax and semantics, known for its use of S-expressions and code-as-data philosophy. So the proposal needs to outline a domain-specific language (DSL) that uses CIDs as part of its structure, allowing the kernel to execute routing logic based on these CIDs.

Looking at the previous discussions, there's a focus on hypergraphs, scenario trees, and formal verification. The routing algorithm needs to be efficient, handle resources correctly, and prevent abuse. The user also emphasized simplicity, so the design shouldn't be overly complex.

The user's README.md describes PromiseGrid as a decentralized system using content-addressable storage and capability-based security. The kernel routes messages based on CIDs, which are hashes of content. So the LISP-like DSL should integrate with this existing architecture.

I should structure the proposal with sections on syntax, semantics, examples, and how it meets the system's requirements. The syntax might involve CIDs as atoms or function calls, the semantics would define how the kernel interprets these CIDs to route messages, and examples would show practical use cases.

I need to ensure that the CID list in each message directs the kernel appropriately. For instance, each CID could represent a function or a rule that the kernel applies. The LISP-like language might allow for composing these CIDs into more complex routing logic.

Also, considering resource management, the DSL might include constructs for specifying resource limits or priorities, which the kernel enforces. The examples should demonstrate how agents can publish CIDs that define their routing logic and how the kernel executes this.

I should reference the search results where applicable, like using Bloom filters for efficient routing or formal methods like TLA+ for verification. The proposal needs to be thorough but concise, covering all necessary aspects without unnecessary complexity.

Finally, the user wants this in a specific file format, so I'll make sure to follow the exact structure and naming they provided, including the markdown file path and proper code blocks.

# LISP-style Routing Language Proposal for PromiseGrid Kernel

## Overview
This proposal describes a LISP-inspired domain-specific language (DSL) that enables content-based message routing in the PromiseGrid kernel using CID lists. The language treats Content Identifiers (CIDs) as first-class entities while maintaining compatibility with PromiseGrid's content-addressed architecture.

## Language Design Principles
1. **CIDs as Atoms**: Every CID serves as an atomic symbol
2. **S-Expression Composition**: Lists represent nested routing operations
3. **Pure Functional Semantics**: No side effects beyond message forwarding
4. **Resource Awareness**: Built-in cost accounting per [RFC 9412](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9412.txt)

## Core Syntax

### Basic Form
```lisp
(route 
  (match (cid QmBaseProtocol)
    (resource-limit :cpu 1000 :mem 256)
    (priority 0.9)
    (next-hop 
      (hash-eq (cid QmTargetAgent)))))
```

### Pattern Matching
```lisp
(defpattern grid-service 
  (cid QmServiceType) 
  (cid QmLocation) 
  (cid QmVersion))

(route
  (match grid-service
    (validate (signature-chain? 3))
    (load-balance 
      (random-select 0.7)
      (fallback (cid QmBackupPool)))))
```

## Semantic Elements

| Construct     | Purpose                          | CID Binding          |
|---------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| `match`       | Content pattern matching         | Direct CID reference|
| `resource`    | Hardware constraints             | Implicit kernel CID |
| `validate`    | Cryptographic checks             | Protocol spec CID   |
| `forward`     | Message propagation              | Target service CID  |

## Example: IoT Sensor Pipeline
```lisp
(route
  (match (cid QmSensorData)
    (resource :max-latency 150ms)
    (parallel
      (chain
        (validate (cid QmDataSchema))
        (store (cid QmColdStorage)))
      (transform 
        (cid QmMLModel)
        (publish (cid QmDashboard))))))
```

## Execution Model
1. **CID Resolution**: Kernel resolves each CID to protocol spec
2. **Pattern Expansion**: Macros expand to primitive routing ops
3. **Resource Allocation**: Tracked via capability tokens
4. **Path Selection**: Choose route with highest utility score

$$ Utility = \frac{ResourceBudget}{Cost} \times TrustWeight $$

## Verification Considerations
1. **Formal Proofs**: Use TLA+ to verify routing convergence
2. **Cost Analysis**: Ensure polynomial time complexity
3. **Causality**: Maintain happens-before relationships

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: CID-based pattern matcher (3 months)
2. **Phase 2**: Macro expansion engine (6 months) 
3. **Final**: Hardware-accelerated evaluator (12 months)

## Advantages Over Traditional Approaches
- **Content-Centric**: Natural fit for IPFS-based systems
- **Composable**: Build complex routes from simple CID elements
- **Formally Verifiable**: Algebraic structure enables proof automation

## Limitations
- Requires CID preprocessing for optimal performance
- Recursive routes need careful cycle detection
- Dynamic loading increases attack surface
