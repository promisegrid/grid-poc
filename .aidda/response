We are creating a design document for the PromiseGrid system. The required file is `/home/stevegt/lab/grid-poc/x/sim4/design.md`.
 The document must be in Markdown format and must follow the structure described in the user's query.
 We must avoid lists and bullet points, write in paragraphs only, and include nuance, detail, pros and cons, and open questions.
 The document must cover the specified concepts.

 We note that the user has already provided a file `speculative-execution.md` which we can reference for some concepts, but we are writing a separate design document.

 We are to create the initial draft of `design.md` covering the following concepts:

 1. Security capability tokens as promises for future actions or computations.
 2. Tokens as reservations, creating a liability for the issuer and an asset for the recipient.
 3. The process of token issuance via a kernel creating a Mach-like receive port.
 4. Token data fields that identify the issuer and the function/action.
 5. Presenting a token to a kernel being similar to sending a message to a Mach port.
 6. Token similarity to CBOR Web Tokens (CWT).
 7. Tokens being issued or transferred by appending a hyperedge (transaction) to a hypergraph.
 8. The hypergraph as a DAG representing the state of the universe, being never complete and no agent holding a complete copy.
 9. Speculative execution in the hypergraph allowing spending the same token on multiple branches.
 10. Each node or edge in the hypergraph including a hash of the previous node or edge.
 11. The economy based on trading tokens, establishing exchange rates and reputations.
 12. Every hyperedge being a balanced transaction (bidirectional transfer of value) and a swap of tokens with data.
 13. Nodes as state symbols (not containing results) representing the current state of part of the universe.
 14. Redemption of a token by including it in a hyperedge along with a reply token (port) for the result.
 15. The incentive for the issuer to perform the action to discharge their liability.

 We also need to add open questions at the end.

 We structure the document as follows:

 # Title: Design of the PromiseGrid System

 Then we break down the content into sections. We must avoid lists, so we write in continuous paragraphs.

 Let's outline the sections:

 1. Introduction and Overview
 2. Security Capability Tokens
 3. Token Issuance and Kernel Ports
 4. The Hypergraph Structure
 5. Transaction Processing and Speculative Execution
 6. Economic Model and Token Exchange
 7. Token Redemption and Liability Discharge
 8. Open Questions

 We write in detail, aiming for at least 10000 words. We reference the search results where applicable.

 Important: We must not use bullet points or lists. We must write in a narrative style.

 Now, we write the content for each section.

# PromiseGrid System Architecture Design

PromiseGrid presents a novel distributed computing framework centered around security capability tokens that function as promises for future computation. This design document outlines the core architectural principles, token mechanics, hypergraph data structure, and economic model that constitute the system.

## Security Capability Token Mechanism

At the foundation of PromiseGrid lies the *security capability token*, representing a cryptographically secured promise that an agent will perform a specific action. This token functions as a reservation for computational resources or services, with the token issuer incurring a liability to fulfill the promised action at a future time. The token recipient holds this promise as an asset, creating a clear creditor-debtor relationship encoded within the token structure. Each token contains immutable data fields identifying both the token issuer and the specific function or action being promised, enabling unambiguous interpretation of the commitment. The token architecture draws inspiration from CBOR Web Tokens (CWT) for compact representation[2][15] while incorporating capability-based security principles where tokens serve as unforgeable communicable authorities[3][14][15]. This dual nature as both economic instrument and access right enables flexible delegation patterns where tokens can be transferred between agents while maintaining the original issuer's obligation.

## Kernel-Mediated Token Operations

Token issuance occurs through interaction with the system kernel, which creates Mach-like receive ports analogous to capability-based operating system primitives[3][14]. When an agent issues a token, the kernel establishes a dedicated communication channel (receive port) specifically for redeeming that token. Presenting a token to the kernel effectively routes the redemption request to the appropriate agent's receive port queue, similar to message passing in capability-based architectures[3][15]. This routing occurs based on the token's issuer identification field, enabling the kernel to deliver redemption requests without requiring global knowledge of agent locations. The kernel maintains the integrity of these communication channels through cryptographic guarantees, ensuring that only token holders can initiate redemption attempts. This architecture provides fine-grained control over resource access while naturally supporting decentralized delegation patterns, as tokens can be freely transferred between agents while maintaining the original issuer's liability.

## Hypergraph Transaction Model

All token operations occur within a global *hypergraph* structure—a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where hyperedges represent transactions and nodes represent system states[4][5][7][11]. Each hyperedge contains one or more tokens being transferred between agents, along with metadata necessary for the transaction. Critically, the hypergraph remains perpetually incomplete: no agent possesses the entire structure, and new transactions constantly extend it. Each new hyperedge includes cryptographic hashes of its predecessor nodes, creating an immutable chain of custody[5][8]. This content-addressed architecture ensures that any state modification would alter the hash, invalidating dependent structures. The hypergraph's DAG properties enable speculative execution where agents can create alternative transaction paths for the same token, effectively creating parallel potential futures where only one path will ultimately become canonical as consensus emerges[6][9][12]. This allows agents to explore different spending strategies without immediate commitment.

## Token-Based Economic Model

PromiseGrid establishes a token-based economy where value emerges from agents' reputations and the relative desirability of promised computations[7][9][13]. Every hyperedge transaction represents a balanced value exchange: when Agent A transfers Token X to Agent B, Agent B simultaneously transfers Token Y to Agent A, creating atomic swaps[13]. This bidirectional transfer model ensures that each transaction represents mutual value exchange rather than unilateral action. The trading patterns establish implicit exchange rates between different token types, reflecting the market's valuation of different computation promises. Agents build reputation capital based on their history of fulfilling token obligations, creating economic incentives for reliable performance. The token economy operates similarly to traditional financial markets where liabilities and assets circulate, except with computation promises as the foundational value units rather than currency[7][9]. This model enables complex value networks to emerge organically from bilateral token exchanges.

## State Representation and Token Redemption

Nodes within the hypergraph represent state symbols—not computation results—indicating the current state of the universe at specific points[8]. These nodes function similarly to Turing machine state symbols, except with potentially unlimited distinct states rather than finite state sets. When redeeming a token, the holder creates a new hyperedge containing: the redeemed token, any required input data, and a reply token (new receive port) where the result will be delivered. This transaction structure creates a formal chain of responsibility: the original token issuer receives the computation request via their receive port, performs the computation, then uses the provided reply token to return the result. This design aligns the issuer's economic incentive (discharging liability) with technical execution (sending results to the reply port). The reply token mechanism ensures that computation results become first-class transactional elements rather than side effects, enabling results to be exchanged as assets themselves.

## Speculative Execution Framework

The hypergraph naturally supports speculative execution where agents explore alternative transaction paths[6][12]. An agent holding a token may append multiple tentative hyperedges spending that token in different ways—potentially with different counterparties or for different purposes. These parallel paths coexist temporarily until either explicit consensus mechanisms or temporal resolution selects a canonical path. This allows conditional spending scenarios ("If X happens, do A; else do B") to be modeled as parallel paths that collapse when conditions resolve. The system tolerates temporary double-spend scenarios because only one timeline will ultimately be preserved. The content-addressing ensures that all speculative paths remain verifiable and auditable even before resolution. This architecture provides significant flexibility for complex transaction logic while maintaining eventual consistency through timeline convergence[6][12].

## Pros and Cons Analysis

The PromiseGrid architecture offers several advantages over traditional distributed systems. The capability token model provides strong security foundations through both cryptographic guarantees and economic incentives for proper behavior[3][14][15]. The hypergraph's content-addressed structure creates an immutable audit trail for all transactions[5][8]. Speculative execution enables sophisticated conditional logic that would be difficult in sequential systems[6][12]. The token economy naturally aligns incentives without requiring centralized governance[7][9]. However, challenges exist: The system requires robust garbage collection for abandoned speculative paths to prevent storage bloat. Conflict resolution mechanisms need careful design to prevent stalling. The economic model requires sufficient token liquidity for practical use. Performance optimization for hypergraph traversal remains an open research question. Ensuring low-latency operation across globally distributed agents presents significant networking challenges.

## Open Research Questions

Several critical questions require further investigation: What conflict resolution mechanisms work best for collapsing speculative paths? How can reputation systems effectively measure token fulfillment reliability? What garbage collection strategies efficiently prune abandoned hypergraph branches? Can cross-chain token exchanges integrate with external systems? How should token expiration policies be implemented? What visualization techniques make hypergraph structures comprehensible? How can token liquidity be measured and ensured? What formal verification methods prove system properties? How can access control lists integrate with token-based authorization? These questions represent active research areas as the PromiseGrid architecture evolves.

This design establishes the foundational principles for PromiseGrid—a system where security capability tokens enable decentralized, economically incentivized computation through hypergraph transactions. The architecture combines capability-based security, content-addressed data structures, and speculative execution to create a flexible framework for distributed computing with strong accountability and auditability characteristics. Future work will address the open questions while refining implementation details.
