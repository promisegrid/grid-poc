Okay, I need to modify the ipldpatch.go file according to the user's instructions. Let me start by understanding what needs to be done. The user wants to remove all code not related to demonstrating patching an IPLD node and printing the before and after structures. They also mentioned borrowing code from ipldexplore.go for printing nodes.

First, looking at the current ipldpatch.go, there's a lot of code for navigation, data structures like UserData, Profile, Settings, and the RunDemo function that does multiple things. The user wants to focus solely on patching and printing, so I should remove the navigation parts and the complex structs.

The RunDemo function currently sets up a multi-block structure with Profile and Settings. But the user wants a simpler example. Maybe create a single node with basic fields, apply a patch, and show before and after. Let me simplify the node structure to something like a map with name and age.

Next, the printing functions. The current exploreNode and explore functions print the structure in a certain way. The ipldexplore.go has a printNode function that uses dagjson to encode the node. I should borrow that to display the node content more clearly. Also, the indentation in explore can be improved by using the printNode approach.

Looking at the applyPatches function, it's using bindnode.Wrap, which might be complicating things. Since we're demonstrating patching, maybe using basicnode to construct a simple node would be better. That way, we don't need the Profile and Settings structs anymore.

I should also check for any code that's not related to patching. The navigate function and the noCloseWriter struct are part of the navigation demo, so those can be removed. The TestRunDemo is probably fine as it just runs the demo, but I'll make sure it's still compatible.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Remove UserData, Profile, Settings structs since they're part of the old example.
2. Simplify RunDemo to create a simple node (e.g., a map with name and age).
3. Replace the exploreNode and explore functions with the printNode function from ipldexplore.go.
4. Update applyPatches to use basicnode instead of bindnode.
5. Ensure the code compiles and runs without errors by testing each part.

Wait, the original RunDemo uses bindnode.Wrap to create nodes. Since we're removing those structs, I should construct nodes manually using basicnode.Prototype.Map. That way, the example is self-contained and doesn't require external struct definitions.

Also, the applyPatches function uses patch operations. The current patches modify Profile/Age and add Settings/Timeout. In the simplified node, maybe change the patch to modify the "age" field directly and add a new field like "city".

I need to adjust the paths in the patch operations. For example, replace "Profile/Age" with "age" and add a new field like "city".

In the printing functions, the exploreNode in ipldexplore.go uses a recursive approach with indentation. I'll adapt that to print the node structure before and after patching.

Also, check the linking system setup. The original uses memstore.Store, which is correct. The code for storing nodes should remain, but simplified to create a single node instead of multiple linked nodes.

After making these changes, I'll verify that the demo function creates a node, prints it, applies patches, and prints the updated node. Ensure that all extraneous code like the navigation demo is removed.

Testing the code mentally: when RunDemo is called, it should create a node, print it, apply patches, and print again. The output should show the initial node and the modified one after patching.

Make sure to remove any unused imports, like "github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/node/bindnode" since we're not using bindnode anymore. Also, check that all panic handling is in place and the code doesn't have any syntax errors.

Finally, ensure that the code is well-commented, explaining each step of creating the node, applying patches, and printing the results. This makes the example clear and easy to understand for someone learning IPLD patching.
