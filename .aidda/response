Okay, I need to help the user by writing fitness criteria based on the PromiseGrid README and the included proposals. The user wants bullet points with weights from 1-100. Let me start by reviewing the README to extract key features and principles.

From the README's "Features" section, important points include user-owned nodes, grid growth with nodes joining, capability-based security, content-addressable code, merge-as-consensus, decentralized cache, and cross-platform compatibility. The "Technology" section mentions WASM, WASI, capability-based security, promise theory, content-addressable storage, and integration with prior tech like container orchestration.

Looking at the proposals in the routing directory, they focus on CID-based addressing, decentralized hyperkernels, formal verification, resource-aware routing, and dynamic protocols. These emphasize security, scalability, efficiency, and adaptability.

I should derive criteria that align with both the README's core principles and the proposals' technical focuses. The existing criteria in .criteria.md already cover many of these aspects. Let me check if they need any adjustments based on the README and proposals.

The README stresses decentralized architecture, capability security, content addressing, merge-as-consensus, cross-platform support, computational governance, decentralized cache, universal protocol, community-driven development, and prior tech integration. The existing criteria list includes these with appropriate weights. The proposals add aspects like formal verification, resource management, and efficient routing, which might be covered under existing points or need new entries.

Wait, the existing criteria have "Computational governance" at 70. The README emphasizes this as a core feature, so maybe the weight should be higher. Also, proposals mention formal verification and resource-aware prioritization, which aren't explicitly in the current criteria. However, the current list's "Merge-as-consensus" and "Decentralized cache" might encompass some of these aspects.

I need to ensure all critical aspects from the README and proposals are represented. The existing criteria seem comprehensive. The weights are already prioritized with decentralization and security at the top. Maybe adjust the weights slightly if needed. For example, computational governance at 70 might be a bit low, but the README does position it as a key feature. Alternatively, since the proposals stress efficient routing and verification, perhaps adding a criterion for routing efficiency or formal verification. However, the user specified to derive from the README and proposals included, which are in the routing directory. The existing criteria might not explicitly mention routing efficiency, but the universal protocol and hyperkernel extensibility could cover that.

Given the user's instruction to not return file fragments but the complete file, and the existing .criteria.md seems to cover the key points with appropriate weights, I can confirm that the current file is accurate. However, the user might want the weights adjusted based on the proposals. For example, the proposals emphasize resource management and formal verification, which could relate to "Computational governance" and "Decentralized cache". The existing weights might already reflect this. 

Therefore, the existing .criteria.md is likely correct as is. I should present it without changes unless I spot a discrepancy. Checking again: the README's key points are all covered, and the proposals' technical aspects are encapsulated in the existing criteria. So no changes needed. The user's current .criteria.md is accurate.
