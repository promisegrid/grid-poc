# Recommended Data Structures for Grid POC

## Problem Statement

The Grid POC aims to efficiently store and retrieve a vast number of large byte sequences and find small subsequences within them. The key requirements are:

- **Large Sequence Storage**:
  - Sizes range from a few bytes to hundreds of gigabytes.
  - Number of sequences ranges from a few to billions.
- **Subsequence Search**:
  - Subsequence sizes range from a few bytes to hundreds of megabytes.
  - Need to efficiently find small subsequences within large sequences.
- **Dynamic Updates and Versioning**:
  - Must handle frequent appends to large sequences.
  - Must handle slight modifications while preserving original sequences (forming a graph structure of versions).

## Recommended Data Structures

Based on the requirements, the following data structures and algorithms are recommended:

### 1. Content-Addressable Storage with Merkle DAGs

#### Description

- **Chunking**:
  - Break large sequences into smaller chunks (e.g., 4 KB to 4 MB).
  - Each chunk is uniquely identified by its cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256).
- **Merkle Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**:
  - Organize chunks in a DAG structure where nodes represent chunks and edges represent the relationship between chunks.
  - Each node's hash is derived from its content and references to child nodes.
  - The root hash represents the entire sequence.

#### Benefits

- **Efficient Storage of Large Sequences**:
  - Large sequences are represented by the root hash and the structure of the DAG.
  - Shared chunks between sequences are stored only once, reducing storage redundancy.
- **Deduplication**:
  - Identical chunks across sequences are automatically deduplicated due to identical hashes.
- **Efficient Versioning and Modifications**:
  - Modifications or appends result in new nodes, but unchanged parts of the DAG are reused.
  - Allows for efficient storage of versions, forming a graph structure of sequence versions.
- **Integrity Verification**:
  - The integrity of sequences can be verified by recalculating and comparing the root hash.

#### Handling Dynamic Updates

- **Frequent Appends**:
  - Appending data involves creating new chunks and updating the DAG structure accordingly.
- **Preserving Original Sequences**:
  - Since the DAG is immutable, modifications create new paths without altering existing nodes.
- **Graph of Versions**:
  - Versions of sequences form a DAG, providing a history of modifications and appends.

#### Considerations

- **Chunk Size Optimization**:
  - Choosing the right chunk size is crucial for balancing storage efficiency and performance.
  - Techniques like content-defined chunking (e.g., using Rabin fingerprints) can be employed to detect changes and optimize deduplication.
- **Metadata Overhead**:
  - Managing the DAG structure requires additional metadata for nodes and their relationships.

### 2. Rabin-Karp Algorithm for Subsequence Searching

#### Description

- **Rolling Hash Function**:
  - Utilizes a rolling hash function to compute hash values for subsequences.
  - Efficiently updates hash values when moving the window over the sequence.
- **Subsequence Search Process**:
  - Preprocess the small subsequence (pattern) to calculate its hash.
  - Slide a window over the large sequence, updating the hash at each step.
  - Compare the rolling hash with the pattern's hash; if they match, verify by comparing the actual bytes.

#### Benefits

- **Efficient Subsequence Search**:
  - Particularly efficient for searching large sequences due to the rolling hash.
- **Handles Variable-Length Subsequences**:
  - Can search for subsequences of varying lengths.
- **Simplicity and Speed**:
  - Straightforward algorithm with good average-case performance.

#### Handling Large Datasets

- **Parallelization**:
  - The search can be parallelized by dividing the large sequence into segments.
- **Chunk-Based Searching**:
  - Combine with chunking in Merkle DAG; perform Rabin-Karp search within and across chunks.
- **Indexing**:
  - Build an index of hash values for chunks or segments to speed up searches for frequently queried subsequences.

#### Considerations

- **Hash Collisions**:
  - Rolling hash functions may produce collisions; requires verification step.
- **Large Alphabet Size**:
  - Since byte values range from 0-255, the hash function must handle a large alphabet.

### 3. Inverted Index

#### Description

- **Indexing Subsequence Occurrences**:
  - Map subsequences to the list of sequences and positions where they occur.
- **Granularity**:
  - Can index fixed-length k-mers (substrings of length k) for manageable index size.

#### Benefits

- **Fast Retrieval**:
  - Quickly identify sequences containing a given subsequence.
- **Flexibility**:
  - Supports various query types, including wildcard and range queries.

#### Considerations

- **Index Size**:
  - Can become large if indexing all possible subsequences.
- **Update Overhead**:
  - Frequent updates require efficient mechanisms to update the index.

### 4. Radix Trees (Prefix Trees)

#### Description

- **Hierarchical Structure**:
  - Keys (e.g., subsequences) are stored in a tree based on shared prefixes.
- **Space Optimization**:
  - Compress paths by merging nodes with a single child.

#### Benefits

- **Efficient Search**:
  - Enables quick lookups by traversing the tree based on byte values.
- **Dynamic Updates**:
  - Supports insertions and deletions efficiently.

#### Considerations

- **Memory Usage**:
  - May consume more memory compared to hash-based methods for large datasets.
- **Implementation Complexity**:
  - Requires careful design to handle variable-length keys and large-scale data.

### 5. Hash-Based Indexing

#### Description

- **Fixed-Size Subsequence Hashing**:
  - Hash fixed-length subsequences and store pointers to their locations.
- **Hash Tables**:
  - Use hash tables for constant-time lookups.

#### Benefits

- **Speed**:
  - Fast insertion and lookup operations.
- **Simplicity**:
  - Easier to implement for fixed-length subsequences.

#### Considerations

- **Subsequence Size Limitation**:
  - Not practical for variable-length or very large subsequences.
- **Collisions**:
  - Need to handle hash collisions, possibly increasing lookup time.

### 6. Combination of Methods

#### Description

- **Hybrid Approaches**:
  - Combine content-addressable storage using Merkle DAGs with efficient search algorithms like Rabin-Karp.
- **Multi-Level Indexing**:
  - Use high-level indexes to narrow down candidate sequences before applying detailed search.

#### Benefits

- **Optimized Performance**:
  - Balances trade-offs between storage efficiency and search speed.
- **Scalability**:
  - Scales better with large data volumes and frequent updates.

#### Considerations

- **Complexity**:
  - Requires careful integration of different data structures and algorithms.
- **Maintenance Overhead**:
  - More complex systems may need sophisticated maintenance strategies.

## Handling Dynamic Updates and Versioning

### Graph Structure for Versions

- **Merkle DAGs for Versioning**:
  - Model sequences and their versions as nodes in a Merkle DAG.
  - Edges represent references to child nodes (chunks) or previous versions.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Data Lineage**:
    - Trace the history of changes.
  - **Efficient Storage**:
    - Shared data between versions is stored only once.
  - **Immutable Data Structures**:
    - Facilitate concurrent access and prevent conflicts.

### Efficient Appends

- **Chunk-Based Updates**:
  - Append new data as new chunks and update DAG references.
- **Preserving Original Sequences**:
  - Original sequences remain intact in the DAG; new versions share common chunks.
- **Version Graph**:
  - Versions form a graph structure, capturing the evolution of sequences over time.

## Conclusion

For the Grid POC, a combination of content-addressable storage using Merkle DAGs and efficient algorithms like Rabin-Karp is recommended:

- **Content-Addressable Storage with Merkle DAGs**:
  - Handles storage of large sequences with deduplication and integrity verification.
  - Efficiently manages frequent appends and modifications while preserving versions in a graph structure.
- **Rabin-Karp Algorithm**:
  - Provides efficient subsequence searching capabilities in large sequences.
  - Particularly suitable for searching within the content-addressable storage structure.
- **Inverted Index and Radix Trees**:
  - Facilitate fast retrieval of subsequences in certain contexts.
  - Useful for fixed-length or common subsequences.
  
By combining these data structures and algorithms, the system can efficiently store and manage large volumes of data, handle dynamic updates, and provide fast subsequence search capabilities, all while maintaining a graph structure of versions for data lineage and integrity.
