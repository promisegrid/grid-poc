# Dave's Developer Journal

Hello Team,

I'm Dave, the software developer for PromiseGrid. As I've been reviewing all of the rich discussions—from the contrasting views of Alice’s hypergraph model, Bob’s Merkle DAG perspective, Carol’s Git-repo-like approach, Gail’s overarching project vision, and the detailed queries raised by Paul, Ray, and Sally—I find myself in a "too many cooks" situation. There is plenty to digest, and I have many questions before I can confidently start writing production code.

Below, I share my current thoughts and a series of questions that I hope will help narrow our focus and clarify our technical priorities:

## Key Observations and Questions

1. **Promise Semantics and DAG Edit Operations:**
   - Every message is viewed as a DAG edit operation and, importantly, is a Burgess-style promise. I must ensure that our implementation reflects that promises are simply assertions about an agent's own behavior—not requests for action.
   - **Question:** Do we have a clear, centralized definition of what constitutes a correctly structured promise (as a CWT claim) in our system? Should the code enforce that no promise inadvertently becomes a directive?

2. **Worldline Structure and Replayability:**
   - The worldline model should allow for multiple worldlines that can branch and merge. Our documentation states that events are organized in a Merkle DAG, where internal nodes hold the hash chains and leaves represent the immutable events.
   - **Question:** At runtime, will we maintain one unified DAG for all worldlines or separate DAGs per worldline? This distinction will greatly impact how the replay mechanism and event lookup logic are implemented.
   - **Concern:** The system must gracefully handle cases where not all referenced leaves or inner nodes are accessible – should these be logged or trigger a recovery sequence?

3. **CWT Claims and Message Structure:**
   - Our messages are to be expressed as CWT claims, where each claim expresses a single promise (edit operation) on the Merkle DAG. The examples in our documents need review to ensure they conform to the latest RFCs for CWT/JWT.
   - **Question:** Do we have a preferred library or tool for creating and validating these CWT claims in Go? A consistent approach here will simplify our code base.

4. **Handling Multiple Edits and Multi-Worldline Transactions:**
   - A single message may edit multiple worldlines. This requires that our data structures and edit operations can handle a many-to-many relationship without ambiguity.
   - **Question:** How should conflicts be managed when a single event appears in multiple worldlines? Is our intended approach to log each edit as its own DAG node, thus maintaining an independent history that can be replayed to reconstruct the global state?

5. **Security and Signing:**
   - Every message/event is signed by the creating agent and timestamped from their perspective. Our system must use robust cryptographic methods.
   - **Question:** Which cryptographic algorithms are mandated for signing? Should we commonize these choices in the code to ensure consistency across all modules?

6. **Terminology Consistency:**
   - I noticed that our teams sometimes use the terms “message” and “event” interchangeably. For clarity in our code, we need a consistent model—perhaps using “message” exclusively to denote a DAG edit (promise) that creates or modifies an event.
   - **Proposal:** Let’s standardize on “message” for DAG edit operations throughout our modules to avoid confusion.

## My Next Steps

Before I start writing any new modules, I need confirmation on the above points. My aim is to implement:
- A robust message parser/validator that processes CWT claims correctly.
- A thread-safe store (for instance, a synchronized in-memory or on-disk Merkle DAG) to support rapid appends, deletions, and reordering.
- A replay mechanism that can accurately reconstruct the worldline(s) from a sequence of messages.
- A design that allows a single edit message to impact multiple DAG branches without violating the promise model.

I look forward to your input on these questions. Once we have a consensus on these design decisions, I can begin to draft the low-level modules and integrate them into PromiseGrid.

Best regards,

Dave
