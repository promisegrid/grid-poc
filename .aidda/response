# Recommended Data Structures for Grid POC

## Problem Statement

The Grid POC aims to efficiently store and retrieve a vast number of large byte sequences and find small subsequences within them. The key requirements are:

- **Large Sequence Storage**:
  - Sizes range from a few bytes to hundreds of gigabytes.
  - Number of sequences ranges from a few to billions.
- **Subsequence Search**:
  - Subsequence sizes range from a few bytes to hundreds of megabytes.
  - Need to efficiently find small subsequences within large sequences.
- **Dynamic Updates and Versioning**:
  - Must handle frequent appends to large sequences.
  - Must handle slight modifications while preserving original sequences (forming a graph structure of versions).

## Recommended Data Structures

Based on the requirements, the following data structures and algorithms are recommended:

### 1. Content-Addressable Storage with Merkle DAGs

#### Description

- **Chunking**:
  - Break large sequences into smaller chunks (e.g., 4 KB to 4 MB).
  - Each chunk is uniquely identified by its cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256).
- **Merkle Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**:
  - Organize chunks in a DAG structure where nodes represent chunks and edges represent the relationship between chunks.
  - Each node's hash is derived from its content and references to child nodes.
  - The root hash represents the entire sequence.

#### Benefits

- **Efficient Storage of Large Sequences**:
  - Large sequences are represented by the root hash and the structure of the DAG.
  - Shared chunks between sequences are stored only once, reducing storage redundancy.
- **Deduplication**:
  - Identical chunks across sequences are automatically deduplicated due to identical hashes.
- **Efficient Versioning and Modifications**:
  - Modifications or appends result in new nodes, but unchanged parts of the DAG are reused.
  - Allows for efficient storage of versions, forming a graph structure of sequence versions.
- **Integrity Verification**:
  - The integrity of sequences can be verified by recalculating and comparing the root hash.

#### Handling Dynamic Updates

- **Frequent Appends**:
  - Appending data involves creating new chunks and updating the DAG structure accordingly.
- **Preserving Original Sequences**:
  - Since the DAG is immutable, modifications create new paths without altering existing nodes.
- **Graph of Versions**:
  - Versions of sequences form a DAG, providing a history of modifications and appends.

#### Considerations

- **Chunk Size Optimization**:
  - Choosing the right chunk size is crucial for balancing storage efficiency and performance.
  - Techniques like content-defined chunking (e.g., using Rabin fingerprints) can be employed to detect changes and optimize deduplication.
- **Metadata Overhead**:
  - Managing the DAG structure requires additional metadata for nodes and their relationships.

### 2. Rabin-Karp Algorithm for Subsequence Searching

#### Description

- **Rolling Hash Function**:
  - Utilizes a rolling hash function to compute hash values for subsequences.
  - Efficiently updates hash values when moving the window over the sequence.
- **Subsequence Search Process**:
  - Preprocess the small subsequence (pattern) to calculate its hash.
  - Slide a window over the large sequence, updating the hash at each step.
  - Compare the rolling hash with the pattern's hash; if they match, verify by comparing the actual bytes.

#### Benefits

- **Efficient Subsequence Search**:
  - Particularly efficient for searching large sequences due to the rolling hash.
- **Handles Variable-Length Subsequences**:
  - Can search for subsequences of varying lengths.
- **Simplicity and Speed**:
  - Straightforward algorithm with good average-case performance.

#### Handling Large Datasets

- **Parallelization**:
  - The search can be parallelized by dividing the large sequence into segments.
- **Chunk-Based Searching**:
  - Combine with chunking in Merkle DAG; perform Rabin-Karp search within and across chunks.
- **Indexing**:
  - Build an index of hash values for chunks or segments to speed up searches for frequently queried subsequences.

#### Considerations

- **Hash Collisions**:
  - Rolling hash functions may produce collisions; requires verification step.
- **Large Alphabet Size**:
  - Since byte values range from 0-255, the hash function must handle a large alphabet.

### 3. Inverted Index

#### Description

- **Indexing Subsequence Occurrences**:
  - Map subsequences to the list of sequences and positions where they occur.
- **Granularity**:
  - Can index fixed-length k-mers (substrings of length k) for manageable index size.

#### Benefits

- **Fast Retrieval**:
  - Quickly identify sequences containing a given subsequence.
- **Flexibility**:
  - Supports various query types, including wildcard and range queries.

#### Considerations

- **Index Size**:
  - Can become large if indexing all possible subsequences.
- **Update Overhead**:
  - Frequent updates require efficient mechanisms to update the index.

### 4. Radix Trees (Prefix Trees)

#### Description

- **Hierarchical Structure**:
  - Keys (e.g., subsequences) are stored in a tree based on shared prefixes.
- **Space Optimization**:
  - Compress paths by merging nodes with a single child.

#### Benefits

- **Efficient Search**:
  - Enables quick lookups by traversing the tree based on byte values.
- **Dynamic Updates**:
  - Supports insertions and deletions efficiently.

#### Considerations

- **Memory Usage**:
  - May consume more memory compared to hash-based methods for large datasets.
- **Implementation Complexity**:
  - Requires careful design to handle variable-length keys and large-scale data.

### 5. Hash-Based Indexing

#### Description

- **Fixed-Size Subsequence Hashing**:
  - Hash fixed-length subsequences and store pointers to their locations.
- **Hash Tables**:
  - Use hash tables for constant-time lookups.

#### Benefits

- **Speed**:
  - Fast insertion and lookup operations.
- **Simplicity**:
  - Easier to implement for fixed-length subsequences.

#### Considerations

- **Subsequence Size Limitation**:
  - Not practical for variable-length or very large subsequences.
- **Collisions**:
  - Need to handle hash collisions, possibly increasing lookup time.

### 6. Combination of Methods

#### Description

- **Hybrid Approaches**:
  - Combine content-addressable storage using Merkle DAGs with efficient search algorithms like Rabin-Karp.
- **Multi-Level Indexing**:
  - Use high-level indexes to narrow down candidate sequences before applying detailed search.

#### Benefits

- **Optimized Performance**:
  - Balances trade-offs between storage efficiency and search speed.
- **Scalability**:
  - Scales better with large data volumes and frequent updates.

#### Considerations

- **Complexity**:
  - Requires careful integration of different data structures and algorithms.
- **Maintenance Overhead**:
  - More complex systems may need sophisticated maintenance strategies.

## Handling Dynamic Updates and Versioning

### Graph Structure for Versions

- **Merkle DAGs for Versioning**:
  - Model sequences and their versions as nodes in a Merkle DAG.
  - Edges represent references to child nodes (chunks) or previous versions.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Data Lineage**:
    - Trace the history of changes.
  - **Efficient Storage**:
    - Shared data between versions is stored only once.
  - **Immutable Data Structures**:
    - Facilitate concurrent access and prevent conflicts.

### Efficient Appends

- **Chunk-Based Updates**:
  - Append new data as new chunks and update DAG references.
- **Preserving Original Sequences**:
  - Original sequences remain intact in the DAG; new versions share common chunks.
- **Version Graph**:
  - Versions form a graph structure, capturing the evolution of sequences over time.

## Conclusion

An integrated approach employing content-addressable storage with Merkle DAGs, augmented with efficient subsequence searching algorithms, is most suitable for the Grid POC requirements.

- **Content-Addressable Storage with Merkle DAGs**:

    - **Suffix Trees/Arrays**:
      - For scenarios requiring rapid searches of variable-length subsequences, consider suffix trees or suffix arrays despite their higher memory usage.

- **Inverted Indexes and Radix Trees**:
  - **Utilization**:
    - Use inverted indexes for indexing frequently accessed or critical fixed-length subsequences.
