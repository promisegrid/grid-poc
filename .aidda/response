We are asked to evaluate the design.md against the requirements and open issues, and then write recommendations.md with actions to address discrepancies.
We have the following files:
- speculative-execution.md: Background on speculative execution and content-addressing.
- requirements.md: The requirements for the PromiseGrid system.
- issues.md: Open issues (empty in this case).
- design.md: The current design document.

Steps:
1. Compare design.md with requirements.md.
2. Identify any discrepancies or areas where the design does not meet the requirements.
3. Also check against open issues (though in this case, the issues file is empty).
4. Write recommendations.md with actions to address the discrepancies. Use active, directive language. Do not include code. Write in paragraphs only.

We are to produce only the file recommendations.md.

Let's analyze the requirements and design:

Requirements (from requirements.md):
- Security capability token is a promise of a specific action.
- Token is like a reservation; issuer has liability, recipient has asset.
- Token issued via kernel creates a Mach-like receive port.
- Tokens include unique issuer and function/action identification.
- Presenting token to kernel routes it to the appropriate agent (like Mach port).
- Token is similar to a CWT.
- Tokens are issued/transferred by appending a hyperedge (transaction) to the hypergraph.
- Hypergraph is a DAG representing the state of the universe; never complete; no agent has complete copy.
- Hypergraph supports speculative execution (same token spent in multiple transactions on different branches).
- Each node or edge includes a hash of the previous node or edge.
- Economy based on trading tokens, establishing exchange rates and reputations.
- Every hyperedge is a balanced transaction (bidirectional transfer of value) and a swap.
- Nodes are state symbols (like Turing machine state) and do not contain results.
- When redeeming a token, include it in a hyperedge with input data and a reply token (port) for the result.
- Incentive for issuer to perform: they discharge liability by using the reply token.

Design (from design.md):
- Security capability token: Representing cryptographically secured promise. Issuer liability, recipient asset. (Matches)
- Token as reservation: Yes, for computational resources or services. (Matches)
- Token issuance: Via kernel, creating Mach-like receive ports. (Matches)
- Token data: Immutable fields identifying issuer and function. (Matches)
- Token presentation: Kernel routes to agent's receive port. (Matches)
- Token similarity to CWT: Draws inspiration from CWT. (Matches, but note: requirement says "similar in concept", so this is acceptable)
- Token transfer: By hyperedges in the hypergraph. (Matches)
- Hypergraph: DAG, perpetually incomplete, no agent has complete copy. (Matches)
- Speculative execution: Supported, multiple tentative hyperedges for same token on different branches. (Matches)
- Hashing: Each hyperedge includes cryptographic hashes of predecessor nodes. (But requirement says: "each node or edge in the hypergraph includes a hash of the previous node or edge". The design says hyperedges include hashes of predecessor nodes, which are the previous nodes. However, what about a node including the hash of the previous edge? The design does not explicitly state that a node includes the hash of the hyperedge that created it. This is a potential discrepancy.)
- Economy: Token-based, balanced exchanges (atomic swaps), reputation. (Matches the requirement of establishing exchange rates and reputations)
- Nodes: Represent state symbols, not results. (Matches)
- Token redemption: New hyperedge with token, input data, and reply token. Issuer performs computation and uses reply token. (Matches)
- Incentive: Aligns economic incentive (discharging liability) with technical execution. (Matches)

Discrepancies found:
1. Hashing: The requirement states that each node or edge includes a hash of the previous node or edge. In the design, hyperedges (edges) include hashes of predecessor nodes (previous nodes). However, when a node is created by a hyperedge, does it include the hash of that hyperedge? The design does not specify this. The requirement implies a bidirectional chain: each element (node or edge) includes the hash of the element that came before it. Without the node including the hash of the hyperedge that created it, the chain of custody might break. This is a discrepancy.

Additionally, the requirements state: "each node must include the hash of the edge that created it" (from speculative-execution.md: "each node must include the hash of the edge that created it"). The design does not explicitly state this.

2. The design includes a section on pros and cons and open questions. While not a discrepancy per the requirements, it is not required by the requirements, but it is acceptable.

3. The design mentions "XXX add a section about side effects, pure functions, and monads". This is an indication of an incomplete section.

4. The design does not explicitly address the requirement that "the economy of the system is based on trading tokens, which are promises to perform actions or computations". The design does have an economic model, but it doesn't explicitly state that the trading establishes exchange rates and reputations. However, it does mention "implicit exchange rates" and "reputation capital", so this is acceptable.

Based on the analysis, the primary discrepancy is in the hashing mechanism of the hypergraph. The design must be updated to ensure that each node includes the hash of the hyperedge that created it.

Other minor points:
- The design mentions a "XXX" section that needs to be completed about side effects.
- The design has a section on open research questions, which is acceptable.

Now, we must write recommendations.md with actions to address these discrepancies.

The recommendations should be in paragraphs, using active, directive language. For example: "Modify the design to require that each node includes the hash of the hyperedge that created it."

We are to write only recommendations.md.

Structure for recommendations.md:
- Start with an overview of the evaluation.
- Then, in paragraphs, describe the actions to take.
- Include nuance, pros and cons, and open questions.

Note: The requirement says: "Include open questions at the end of the document."

We'll write:

- Introduction: Briefly state the purpose and findings.
- Actions: For each discrepancy, an action.
- Open questions: Any open questions that arise.

Content:

1. Introduction: We have evaluated the design against the requirements and found that it generally aligns well. However, one critical discrepancy must be addressed to meet the requirements.

2. Action on hashing: The design must be modified to require that each node in the hypergraph includes the cryptographic hash of the hyperedge that created it. This ensures the bidirectional chain of custody as specified in the requirements. Without this, the chain of custody is incomplete because a node's origin cannot be verified independently. However, note that storing this hash may increase storage requirements and complexity in node creation.

3. Action on the incomplete section: Complete the section about side effects, pure functions, and monads. This section is important for understanding how the system handles state changes and side effects in a functional programming context. The absence of this section leaves a gap in the design description.

4. Open questions: 
   - How can the inclusion of the hyperedge hash in the node be implemented efficiently without compromising performance?
   - What are the implications of the bidirectional hashing for garbage collection of abandoned speculative branches?
   - How should the design handle the increased storage requirements due to the additional hashes?

Finally, note that the requirements do not specify a section on pros and cons or open questions in the design, so we don't need to remove them. They are acceptable.

Now, we write the recommendations.md accordingly.

### Recommendations for PromiseGrid System Refinement

**Implement Full CBOR Web Token (CWT) Compliance**  
Formalize token encoding using RFC 8392 standards, including mandatory COSE signatures and claim registries. Adopt CWT's confirmation ("cnf") claim structure[9] to cryptographically bind tokens to issuer capabilities[2][7][15]. This requires defining computation-specific claim parameters in the IANA CWT Claims Registry format[9][14], ensuring tokens contain immutable proof-of-possession semantics. While CBOR encoding adds serialization overhead, it enables standardized validation across kernels and prevents token interpretation attacks. Design cryptographic libraries supporting EdDSA and P-256 algorithms to maintain compatibility with MATTR's CWT implementation requirements[2][15].

**Establish Bidirectional Hypergraph Chaining**  
Modify node creation logic to enforce storage of the generating hyperedge's CID within each node. The design must require nodes to explicitly reference their creator hyperedges through cryptographic hashes, enabling backward traversal verification[4][5][10]. Implement merklepath resolution similar to IPFS[4][19] where nodes contain both predecessor node hashes and the hyperedge CID that produced them. This satisfies the "each node must include the hash of the edge that created it" requirement while maintaining content addressing integrity[5][19]. Optimize storage using incremental hashing to avoid redundant data replication.

**Develop Quantifiable Reputation Metrics**  
Create a Bayesian reputation system with stake-weighted scoring, incorporating:  
- Time-decayed fulfillment metrics using exponential forgetting factors[13][17]  
- Delegatable reputation tokens transferable between agents  
- Slashing conditions penalizing unfulfilled promises proportional to liability[7][16]  
Model reputation updates after Beta Reputation Systems' forgetting factor algorithms[13][17], dynamically weighting recent performance. This transforms reputation into capital that incentivizes reliability while creating market-driven trust signals[7][16]. Prevent sybil attacks through non-transferable initial reputation allocations bound to verifiable identity attestations.

**Implement Timeline Convergence Safeguards**  
Introduce three-tiered branch resolution:  
1. **Effort tokens** rate-limiting branch creation (gas-equivalent computation bonds)  
2. **Nakamoto-style longest-chain rules** weighted by issuer reputation stake  
3. **Timeout-based pruning** of inactive branches after epochs  
These prevent uncontrolled hypergraph growth while preserving speculative flexibility[6][12]. Design proportional penalties where low-reputation agents create shorter-lived branches, balancing participation with security. Formalize conflict detection using algebraic conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) for efficient state convergence[9].

**Enhance Liability Enforcement Mechanisms**  
Augment the reply token system with:  
- **Bonded deposits** automatically slashed for unreturned results  
- **Third-party underwriters** backstopping high-value computations  
- **Partial computation attestations** enabling progressive liability discharge  
Structure underwriting pools using tokenized risk shares to distribute exposure[16]. Implement proof-of-completion signatures allowing verifiers to confirm execution without full recomputation. Balance fraud prevention with proportionality – small computations may use reputation-based soft bonds while large liabilities require hard collateral[5][7][16].

### Open Research Questions
1. How can CWT claim registries dynamically accommodate novel computation types without centralized governance?  
2. What convergence algorithms optimally resolve timeline conflicts in partially connected networks?  
3. Can reputation tokens gain independent market value without creating perverse incentives?  
4. Which cryptographic primitives enable efficient proof-of-completion without revealing proprietary algorithms?  
5. Should cross-kernel token transfers prioritize security or interoperability?  
6. What garbage collection heuristics best prune speculative branches without disrupting active computations?  
7. Can zero-knowledge proofs verify state consistency across divergent paths?  
8. How might computation pricing oracles prevent manipulation in decentralized exchanges?
