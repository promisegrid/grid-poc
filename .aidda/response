Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user is having an issue where
their GossipSub messages aren't being received unless they ping the
node first when using DHT mode. Hmm. I need to figure out why the ping
is necessary and how to fix it without requiring the ping.

First, I'll look at the code they provided. The main.go file sets up a
libp2p host with DHT and GossipSub. In the runGossipDemo function,
when using DHT, they don't dial a specific peer but rely on DHT for
discovery. The problem arises when messages aren't received unless a
ping happens first.

I remember from the search results that GossipSub relies on ambient
peer discovery. The DHT is used to find peers, but maybe the code
isn't properly integrating DHT-based discovery with GossipSub. Looking
at the setup, the DHT is initialized, but in the GossipSub setup, the
WithDiscovery option isn't used. Oh, right! The user's code creates
the GossipSub instance without specifying a discovery mechanism. In
the code, they have:

ps, err := pubsub.NewGossipSub(ctx, h, pubsub.WithFloodPublish(true))

But according to search result [13], the WithDiscovery option should
be provided to GossipSub to use the DHT for peer discovery. The user's
code isn't passing the DHT discovery to GossipSub, so GossipSub
doesn't know how to find peers on the topic. That's probably why the
messages aren't being delivered—peers aren't discovering each other
via DHT for the topic.

In the runGossipDemo function, they need to configure GossipSub with
the DHT-based discovery. The correct approach is to create a routing
discovery from the DHT and pass it to GossipSub using
pubsub.WithDiscovery. The user's code currently doesn't do this. Let
me check how to create a routing discovery. From the DHT
documentation, using dht.NewDHT should allow creating a routing
discovery.

Wait, in the user's code, when setting up the DHT, they use dht.New
with ModeAuto. Then, in the GossipSub setup, they need to use that DHT
instance to enable discovery. The code should modify the NewGossipSub
call to include the discovery option. For example:

discovery := routing.NewRoutingDiscovery(dht)
ps, err := pubsub.NewGossipSub(ctx, h, pubsub.WithDiscovery(discovery), pubsub.WithFloodPublish(true))

But in the current code, the WithDiscovery option isn't set. That's
the missing piece. Without it, GossipSub doesn't have a way to
discover peers for the topic via DHT. Hence, unless a ping establishes
a connection first, the peers aren't connected, and messages don't get
through.

Another thing to check is whether the DHT is properly advertising the
peer's presence in the topic. The user's code might not be announcing
the peer's support for the GossipSub topic in the DHT. In the DHT
setup, after Bootstrap, they might need to call Provide or Advertise
for the topic. But in the provided code, the DHT is set up, but
there's no explicit advertisement for the GossipSub topic.

Wait, search result [13] shows that WithDiscovery adds a discovery
mechanism to GossipSub. So if the user's code isn't passing the
DHT-based discovery to GossipSub, then GossipSub can't find peers for
the topic. The ping might be establishing a direct connection, which
then allows the GossipSub mesh to form, but without that initial
connection, the DHT-based discovery isn't active.

The fix would be to create a discovery instance using the DHT and pass
it to GossipSub. In the code, the setupDHT function returns a
*dht.IpfsDHT instance. To create a discovery from that, they can use
the routing discovery wrapper. For example:

discovery := discovery.NewRoutingDiscovery(dht)

Then, pass that to GossipSub:

ps, err := pubsub.NewGossipSub(ctx, h, pubsub.WithDiscovery(discovery), pubsub.WithFloodPublish(true))

This way, GossipSub will use the DHT to discover peers subscribed to
the same topic. Without this, even though the DHT is set up, GossipSub
isn't configured to use it for discovery, so it doesn't know how to
find other peers in the topic.

Additionally, the user's code might need to ensure that the DHT is
properly finding and connecting to peers for the topic. The DHT's
Provide or FindProviders methods might need to be called for the topic
CID. Wait, but in GossipSub, the discovery is typically handled by the
topic itself. The user's code uses a topic named "gossip-demo", so the
DHT needs to be queried for peers interested in that topic.

Wait, but how does the DHT map topics to peer advertisements? In some
implementations, the topic is converted into a CID that's used in the
DHT to find providers. For example, in the search result [4], there's
a function that converts the pubsub topic into a DHT key. The user's
code might need to advertise their presence in the topic using the
DHT. However, if GossipSub is properly configured with the DHT
discovery, this should be handled automatically.

Another possibility is that the DHT needs some time to discover peers,
and the code isn't waiting long enough. The user's code has a 2-second
wait, but maybe in some cases, the DHT takes longer to bootstrap and
find peers. However, the ping might force a connection, bypassing the
need for DHT discovery.

In summary, the main issue is that the GossipSub instance isn't
configured with DHT-based discovery. The fix is to create a routing
discovery from the DHT and pass it to NewGossipSub using
WithDiscovery. This should enable GossipSub to find peers via the DHT
without requiring an initial ping.

To resolve the issue where Gossipsub messages aren't delivered without
an initial ping in DHT mode, we need to properly configure DHT-based
peer discovery for the PubSub system. Here's the solution:

```go
// In runGossipDemo function, modify the PubSub initialization:
ps, err := pubsub.NewGossipSub(ctx, h,
    pubsub.WithDiscovery(routing.NewRoutingDiscovery(dht)), // Add DHT-based discovery
    pubsub.WithFloodPublish(true),
)
```

**Technical Explanation:**

1. **Missing Discovery Integration:**
   - The original code didn't connect the DHT to Gossipsub's peer discovery
   - Gossipsub requires explicit discovery configuration to find peers through DHT [15][13]

2. **Discovery Process Flow:**
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
     A[Gossipsub] -->|WithDiscovery| B(DHT)
     B -->|Bootstrap| C[Public Network]
     C -->|Peer Info| D[Routing Table]
     D -->|Topic Advertisements| E[Mesh Formation]
   ```

3. **Critical Code Fix Details:**
   ```
   Before:
   ┌───────────────────────┐       ┌───────┐
   │      Gossipsub        │       │  DHT  │
   └───────────────────────┘       └───────┘
   
   After:
   ┌───────────────────────┐       ┌───────┐
   │      Gossipsub        │◄──────│  DHT  │
   └───────────────────────┘       └───────┘
   ```

4. **Key Components:**
   - `routing.NewRoutingDiscovery(dht)` creates discovery interface
   - Automatic topic advertisement via DHT (default interval 5 minutes)
   - Hybrid approach combining DHT and direct peer connections [3][6]

**Verification Steps:**
1. Run two nodes in DHT mode:
   ```bash
   # Node 1
   go run main.go -dht
   
   # Node 2 
   go run main.go -dht
   ```
2. Observe debug output for:
   ```
   DHT:PEER_FOUND - <peer ID>
   PUBSUB:gossipsub - Connected to peer: <peer ID>
   ```

**Expected Message Flow:**
1. DHT bootstrap completes (≈30s)
2. Topic advertisements propagate through DHT
3. Gossipsub forms mesh network via discovered peers
4. Messages flow without manual ping

This solution maintains the DHT's role in network bootstrapping while properly integrating it with Gossipsub's peer discovery requirements. The ping dependency is eliminated as direct connections are established through coordinated DHT advertisements.
