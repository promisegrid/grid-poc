Okay, I need to clean up the ipld-cross code by removing any parts that aren't directly related to demonstrating IPLD cross-block path traversal. Let me look through the provided files.

Starting with ipldcross.go. The UserData struct links to Profile and Settings, which are separate blocks. The RunDemo function sets up the linking system, creates blocks, and demonstrates navigation and patching. The navigate function handles path traversal, which is key here. The exploreNode and explore functions are for data exploration, which might be extra if the focus is solely on traversal. The applyPatches function uses IPLD patches, which could be part of demonstrating modifications but maybe not essential for basic traversal.

Wait, the user wants to remove extraneous code. The main goal is to keep the cross-block path traversal. So, the patch application and data exploration parts might be considered extra. Let me check:

- The RunDemo function has sections for data exploration and applying patches. Those could be removed to simplify the example.
- The exploreNode and explore functions are used for printing the structure, which isn't necessary for the core traversal demo.
- The applyPatches function and related code (like the patch imports) can be removed since they're about modifying data, not just traversing.

Also, the TestRunDemo in the test file just runs the demo. If we simplify the demo, the test should still work but might need adjustments if the demo function changes.

So, to focus on traversal, I should:

1. Remove the applyPatches function and all related patch code.
2. Remove the exploreNode and explore functions.
3. Simplify the RunDemo function to only demonstrate navigation across blocks.
4. Update imports to remove unused packages like "bytes", "github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/traversal/patch", etc.
5. Ensure that the test file still tests the remaining functionality.

Let me go through the code step by step.

In ipldcross.go:

- The import section includes "bytes", "github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/traversal/patch" — these can be removed if patches are taken out.
- The UserData, Profile, Settings structs are necessary as they form the linked data structure.
- The RunDemo function creates profile, settings, and root blocks. Then, it demonstrates navigation. The parts about data exploration and patches can be removed.
- The navigate function is essential for traversal, so keep that.
- The exploreNode and explore functions can be deleted.
- The applyPatches function and fromJSONString can be removed.
- The noCloseWriter struct is used in navigate, so it stays.

In the test file, TestRunDemo just calls RunDemo. If RunDemo no longer has patches or exploration, the test should still pass as long as the demo runs without panicking.

Now, adjusting the RunDemo function:

- Remove the sections that print "Data Exploration" and "Applying Patches".
- Remove the post-patch navigation and exploration steps.
- Keep the initial navigation steps.

So the updated RunDemo would create the blocks and then perform the initial navigations. The output would just show navigating to Profile/Age and Settings/Active.

Let me also check for any other unused variables or functions. For example, the applyPatches function uses the ls variable, but if we remove that function, the ls in RunDemo is still used for storing the root node, which is necessary.

I should also update comments to reflect the simplified example, ensuring they explain the traversal without mentioning the removed features.

Finally, ensure that the code compiles and the test runs. Removing unused imports and functions should prevent any compilation errors. The test should still call RunDemo, which now only does navigation, so it should work.
