We are given multiple files: `speculative-execution.md`, `event-sourcing.md`, `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `issues.md`, `recommendations.md`, and `references.md`. The task is to evaluate `design.md` against the requirements in `requirements.md`, discuss discrepancies in `issues.md`, make recommendations in `recommendations.md`, and update `design.md` accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Plan

#### 1. Understand Requirements
The `requirements.md` file lists 15 requirements for the PromiseGrid system. These cover:
- Security capability tokens as promises/reservations
- Token issuance creating liabilities/assets
- Kernel-mediated token operations (Mach-like ports)
- Token data fields and CWT similarity
- Hypergraph structure (DAG, speculative execution, hashing)
- Token-based economy and hyperedges as balanced swaps
- Nodes as state symbols (not containing results)
- Token redemption with reply tokens
- Incentives for issuers

#### 2. Review Design Document
`design.md` is structured into sections:
- Token mechanism (security, kernel interaction)
- Hypergraph model (DAG, content addressing)
- Economic model (token swaps, reputation)
- State representation and redemption
- Speculative execution framework
- Pros/cons and open questions

#### 3. Compare Design with Requirements
We need to check alignment for each requirement. Key observations:
- Token mechanics and kernel operations align well.
- Hypergraph structure matches overall but has hashing ambiguities.
- Economic model lacks explicit exchange rate mechanisms.
- Node-as-state-symbol concept is implemented but could be clearer.
- Speculative execution is covered but lacks resolution details.
- Redemption workflow is described but misses failure modes.

#### 4. Identify Discrepancies
From the comparison, we note:
- **Hashing Requirements**: The design states hyperedges hash predecessor nodes but doesn't specify node-hyperedgedge bidirectional hashing as required.
- **CWT Integration**: Token-CWT alignment is superficial without implementation specifics.
- **Economic Mechanics**: Exchange rate formation is assumed but not designed.
- **Failure Handling**: Redemption doesn't address computation failures or timeouts.
- **Speculative Execution**: Resolution mechanisms are undefined.

#### 5. Discuss Discrepancies in Issues
We update `issues.md` to highlight:
- Hashing ambiguity between nodes/hyperedges
- Lack of CWT claim encoding details
- Absence of market-driven token valuation
- Redemption liability discharge risks
- Speculative branch convergence mechanisms

#### 6. Make Recommendations
In `recommendations.md`, we propose:
- Explicit bidirectional hashing in the hypergraph
- Standardized CWT claim encoding
- Reputation-weighted valuation mechanics
- Timeout slashing conditions for issuers
- Stake-weighted timeline convergence

#### 7. Update Design Document
We modify `design.md` to:
- Add hyperedge-hashing details in the hypergraph section
- Expand token section with CWT implementation specifics
- Enhance economic model with emergent valuation details
- Include redemption failure modes and liability enforcement
- Specify speculative execution resolution protocols

#### 8. Verify References
We ensure all references in `references.md` support the updates, adding new citations as needed for CWT, hashing patterns, and conflict resolution.

### Final Output Structure
We return the updated files:
- `issues.md` with added discrepancies
- `recommendations.md` with actionable proposals
- `design.md` with reconciled content
- Other files unchanged unless conflicts exist

We now proceed to implement these changes in the file outputs.

### Recommendations for PromiseGrid System Refinement

To bridge identified gaps between specifications and architectural implementation, the following enhancements should prioritize **cryptographic verifiability**, **economic incentive alignment**, and **speculative execution robustness**. These recommendations address core discrepancies while preserving the system's innovative distributed computation model.

#### 1. Strengthen Hypergraph Hashing Protocols
Implement **bidirectional hashing constraints** to formalize chain-of-custody guarantees. Each hyperedge must include cryptographic hashes of its tail nodes, while each new node must contain the hash of its generating hyperedge. This creates a tamper-evident structure where:
- State derivation requires traversing node-hyperedgedge-node sequences
- Any alteration breaks downstream hash references
- Audit paths become trivially verifiable[5][8][10]
Adopt the RFC 8392 standard for hash-tree structures to ensure compatibility with content-addressed systems like IPFS[3][7][20].

#### 2. Formalize CWT Token Implementation
Integrate **CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)** for standard-compliant token encoding. Structure security capability tokens as:
```
{
  "iss": "agent_id",
  "cty": "capability/v1",
  "prm": {
    "action": "compute:matrix_inversion",
    "deadline": 1690234567,
    "max_resource": "TFLOPS-120"
  },
  "rep": "reply_port_id"
}
```
Require token issuers to sign payloads using EdDSA signatures as per RFC 8037. This enables:
- Standardized claim verification
- Protocol-level interoperability
- Automated liability enforcement[3][7][15]

#### 3. Enhance Economic Incentive Mechanisms
Introduce **reputation-weighted valuation** where token exchange rates incorporate:
```math
V_{token} = \frac{{\sum_{i=1}^{n} F_i \times R_i}}{{\sum_{i=1}^{n} D_i}}
```
Where:
- **F** = Successful fulfillments
- **R** = Reputation score (0-1)
- **D** = Defaults/deadline misses
This creates market-driven pricing while disincentivizing fraud[7][9][16]. Implement **timeout slashing conditions** where:
- Unredeemed reply tokens after deadline convert to liability claims
- Issuers forfeit stake proportional to computational value
- Claimants receive compensation from slashed funds[5][16]

#### 4. Refine Speculative Execution Framework
Develop **stake-weighted timeline convergence** where:
1. Agents proposing branches post computational bonds
2. Conflicting branches trigger Byzantine fault tolerance voting
3. Bonds redistribute to voters in winning branch
4. Abandoned branches trigger bond forfeiture[6][9][12]

Implement **branch decay coefficients** using:
```math
W_b = e^{-\lambda t} \times \frac{S_b}{S_{total}}
```
Where:
- **λ** = Decay rate (e.g., 0.01/sec)
- **S** = Staked computation resources
- **t** = Time since branch creation
This automatically prunes low-stake/low-activity branches while preserving high-value speculation paths[6][9][12].

#### 5. Strengthen Liability Enforcement
Introduce **recursive liability tracing** where:
- Unfulfilled computations generate claim tokens
- Claims propagate to original issuers via transaction graphs
- Persistent defaults trigger reputation decay cascades
Implement **computation insurance pools** where:
1. Issuers deposit collateral proportional to promise risk
2. Valid claims draw from pooled funds
3. Premiums adjust based on fulfillment history[1][5][16]

#### 6. Address Kernel Implementation Gaps
Develop **capability revocation protocols** for port management:
- Time-bound capability leases (e.g., 24-hour default)
- Delegation depth limits (max 3 hops)
- Revocation certificates for expired ports[3][14][15]
Implement **cross-kernel routing tickets** using:
1. Local kernel verifies destination availability
2. Issues signed routing token with TTL
3. Intermediate kernels append routing histograms
4. Destination kernel validates full path[3][9]

#### Implementation Priorities
1. **Immediate**: Bidirectional hashing and COSE token encoding
2. **Short-term**: Reputation-weighted pricing and timeout slashing
3. **Mid-term**: Stake-weighted convergence and branch decay
4. **Long-term**: Cross-kernel federation and insurance mechanisms

These recommendations preserve PromiseGrid's core innovations while addressing critical security, incentive, and verifiability gaps. The enhancements establish rigorous cryptographic foundations, align economic incentives with technical behaviors, and enable practical resolution of speculative execution paths—transforming theoretical constructs into operable distributed infrastructure.

# PromiseGrid System Architecture Design

PromiseGrid presents a novel distributed computing framework centered around security capability tokens that function as promises for future computation. This revised design addresses identified discrepancies while preserving the system's core innovations in capability-based security, hypergraph transactions, and speculative execution workflows.

## Enhanced Security Capability Token Implementation

### Standard-Compliant Token Encoding
Tokens now implement **RFC 8392 CBOR Web Token (CWT) standards** with explicit claim structure:
```
{
  "iss": "agent_identifier",  // Token issuer ID
  "iat": 1689984000,          // Issuance timestamp
  "prm": {                    // Promise claims
    "action": "compute:fft",
    "deadline": 1692576000,
    "resource": "GPU-8GB"
  },
  "rep": "reply_port_hash"    // Result return destination
}
```
All tokens require **EdDSA signatures** using issuer private keys, enabling cryptographic proof of liability. Token headers include **capability delegation chains** documenting transfer history through nested COSE_Key structures per RFC 8152[3][7][15]. This creates unforgeable audit trails while maintaining CWT interoperability.

### Kernel-Level Liability Enforcement
The kernel now implements **liability discharge triggers** where:
1. Unredeemed tokens after deadline convert to claim tokens
2. Claim tokens permit partial stake seizure
3. Repeated defaults decay issuer reputation scores
**Cross-kernel revocation tickets** enable port cleanup by:
- Issuing time-bound (TTL: 24h) capability certificates
- Propagating revocation notices through gossip protocol
- Automatically reclaiming ports from unresponsive agents[3][14]

## Hypergraph Structure with Cryptographic Bindings

### Bidirectional Content Addressing
The hypergraph now enforces **tamper-evident linkage** through dual hashing:
1. Each hyperedge includes SHA3-256 hashes of all tail nodes
2. Each new node contains the hash of its generating hyperedge
3. Genesis nodes use deterministic initialization vectors
This creates a **Merkle proof chain** where state derivation requires:
1. Start from known genesis hash
2. Follow hyperedge-node-hyperedgedge sequences
3. Validate hashes at each transition[5][8][10]

### Speculative Execution Framework
**Stake-weighted branch resolution** prevents hypergraph bloat:
1. Agents propose branches with computation-stake bonds
2. Conflicting branches trigger BFT voting among bondholders
3. Winning branch absorbs 90% of losing bonds
4. Remaining 10% distributes to voters
**Branch decay dynamics** automatically prune paths using:
```math
W_b = e^{-\lambda t} \times \frac{S_b}{S_{total}}
```
Where:
- λ = Configurable decay rate (default: 0.01/sec)
- S = Staked computation resources
- t = Time since creation[6][9][12]

## Token-Based Economic Model Enhancements

### Market-Driven Valuation Mechanics
Token exchange rates emerge through **reputation-weighted pricing**:
```math
V_{token} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} (F_i \times R_i) }{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} D_i }
```
Where:
- F = Successful fulfillments (last 30 days)
- R = Reputation score (0.0 - 1.0)
- D = Defaults/deadline misses
This combines historical performance with market activity to establish fair value[7][9][16].

### Computation Insurance Pools
**Risk mutualization mechanisms** protect token holders:
1. Issuers deposit collateral proportional to promise risk
2. Valid claims draw from pooled funds
3. Premiums adjust dynamically based on:
   - Historical fulfillment rate
   - Computational complexity
   - Deadline urgency
Pool governance uses **reputation-quadratic voting** to prevent manipulation[1][5][16].

## State Representation and Token Redemption

### Pure Function Execution Model
All computations implement **side-effect-free semantics**:
1. Redemption requests include input data blobs
2. Executors process inputs in sandboxed environments
3. Results sign with executor keys
4. Original issuer remains liable for validation
This enables **verifiable computation reuse** through deterministic replay.

### Enhanced Redemption Workflow
The revised redemption protocol:
1. Holder creates hyperedge containing:
   - Redeemed token (signed)
   - Input data CID
   - New reply token
2. Kernel routes to issuer's receive port
3. Issuer either:
   a) Executes computation, returns result via reply token, OR
   b) Delegates to executor with liability chain
4. Failure triggers:
   - Automatic claim token generation
   - Reputation decay
   - Stake seizure after dispute period[3][5]

## Implementation Roadmap

### Priority Features
1. **COSE token encoding** - Q1 2025
2. **Bidirectional hashing enforcement** - Q1 2025
3. **Reputation oracle service** - Q2 2025
4. **Automated claim adjudication** - Q3 2025

### Optimization Targets
1. Branch decay simulation tuning
2. Delegation depth impact analysis
3. Insurance pool risk modeling
4. Cross-kernel latency benchmarks

## Open Research Questions
1. What **formal methods** verify state consistency across divergent paths?
2. How do **delegation chains** impact liability attribution depth?
3. Can **zero-knowledge proofs** validate computations without disclosure?
4. What **graph pruning heuristics** optimize storage without sacrificing auditability?
5. How should **temporal consensus bounds** handle relativistic effects in global deployment?

This refined architecture establishes PromiseGrid as a verifiable, incentive-aligned framework for decentralized computation. By reconciling cryptographic accountability with economic security, the system enables trustworthy speculative execution at internet scale.
