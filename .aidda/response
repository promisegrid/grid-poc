<think>
Okay, I need to address the user's request to move the grid tag into wire.go and fix the test errors. Let me start by looking at the problem.

The user provided the test output, which shows that the TestEmptyMessage/nil_fields is failing. The error messages indicate that the test expects nil protocol and payload, but after unmarshaling, they are getting empty slices instead. 

Looking at the current code in wire.go, the Message struct's MarshalCBOR method converts nil slices to empty slices. This is done to encode them as empty byte strings. However, during unmarshaling, when the CBOR decoder encounters an empty byte string (0x40), it decodes it as an empty []byte, not nil. That's why the test is failing when the original message has nil fieldsâ€”they become empty slices after round-tripping.

The user wants the nil fields to remain nil after marshaling and unmarshaling. The current approach converts nil to empty slices, which causes the discrepancy. 

In CBOR, a nil slice (in Go) is typically encoded as null (0xF6), while an empty slice is encoded as an empty byte string (0x40). However, the current code is forcing nil slices to be encoded as empty byte strings. To preserve the nil values, we need to allow the encoder to handle nil slices as nulls.

Wait, but in the MarshalCBOR method, the code explicitly converts nil Protocol and Payload to empty slices. That's why when you marshal a Message with nil fields, they become empty byte strings instead of null. So the fix would be to remove that conversion and let the CBOR encoder handle nil slices properly.

But how does the fxamacker/cbor library handle nil slices by default? According to the search results, the default behavior for nil slices is to encode them as null (0xF6). For example, in the code from [1], the NilContainersMode determines whether nil slices are encoded as null or empty containers. The default is NilContainerAsNull.

So, if we don't convert nil to empty slices in MarshalCBOR, the encoder should output null for nil slices. However, in the current test case for "nil fields", the expected CBOR has 0x40 (empty byte string) for protocol and payload. But if we allow nil to be encoded as null, the expected data would need to be 0xF6 instead of 0x40. 

Wait, the user's test case for "nil fields" is expecting the nil Protocol and Payload to be encoded as empty byte strings (0x40). But according to the CBOR library's default behavior, nil slices should be encoded as null (0xF6). However, the current code in MarshalCBOR is converting nil to empty slices, which is why the test expects 0x40. But the user's test is failing because after unmarshaling, the fields are empty slices instead of nil.

The user's goal is probably to have nil slices remain nil after round-tripping. To do that, the MarshalCBOR should not convert nil to empty slices. Let me check the code again.

In wire.go's MarshalCBOR method:

func (m Message) MarshalCBOR() ([]byte, error) {
	// Convert nil slices to empty slices to encode as empty byte strings
	proto := m.Protocol
	if proto == nil {
		proto = []byte{}
	}
	payload := m.Payload
	if payload == nil {
		payload = []byte{}
	}
	return em.Marshal([]interface{}{gridTag, proto, payload})
}

This code is explicitly converting nil slices to empty slices, causing them to be encoded as empty byte strings (0x40) instead of null (0xF6). The user's test case for "nil fields" is expecting the nil to be preserved, but because of this conversion, they are marshaled as empty slices, and upon unmarshaling, they become empty slices (not nil), hence the test failure.

The solution is to remove the nil to empty slice conversion in the MarshalCBOR method. Let the encoder handle nil slices as null. However, the user's test case for "nil fields" is currently expecting 0x40 (empty byte string), but if we stop converting nil to empty, the encoded value would be 0xF6 (null), which would decode back to nil.

So, the user's test case for "nil fields" needs to be updated. The current expected CBOR for nil fields is:

0x83,                   // array(3)
0x44, 0x67, 0x72, 0x69, 0x64, // grid tag
0x40, // empty protocol bytes (previously was F6 for nil)
0x40, // empty payload bytes (previously was F6 for nil)

But if we stop converting nil to empty, the protocol and payload would be encoded as null (0xF6), so the expected CBOR should have 0xF6 instead of 0x40. Then, upon unmarshaling, the fields would be nil.

Therefore, the fix involves two steps:

1. Modify the MarshalCBOR method in wire.go to not convert nil slices to empty slices.
2. Update the test case in wire_test.go to expect null (0xF6) for nil fields.

Let me adjust the code accordingly.

In wire.go, remove the conversion:

func (m Message) MarshalCBOR() ([]byte, error) {
	return em.Marshal([]interface{}{gridTag, m.Protocol, m.Payload})
}

But wait, in CBOR, a nil []byte is encoded as null, not as an empty byte string. However, in Go, a nil []byte is different from an empty slice. The fxamacker/cbor library, by default, when encoding a nil slice, will encode it as null. Let me confirm this with the documentation.

From search result [1], the code has a NilContainersMode which defaults to NilContainerAsNull. Also, in the code comments, it says: "NilContainerAsNull encodes nil slices and maps as CBOR null."

So, if the Protocol or Payload is nil, they should be encoded as null. Therefore, in the MarshalCBOR method, we should not convert them to empty slices. So, removing the conversion code.

Then, in the test case for "nil fields", the expected CBOR should have 0xF6 (null) for the protocol and payload fields. However, looking at the current test case, the expected bytes are using 0x40 (empty byte string). That's why after unmarshaling, the fields are empty slices instead of nil.

Therefore, in wire_test.go, the test case for "nil fields" needs to be updated to expect 0xF6 instead of 0x40.

The original test case for "nil fields" has:

expected: []byte{
	0x83,                   
	0x44, 0x67, 0x72, 0x69, 0x64, 
	0x40, // empty protocol bytes (previously was F6 for nil)
	0x40, // empty payload bytes (previously was F6 for nil)
},

But after fixing the code, the nil slices should be encoded as null (0xF6), so the expected should be:

expected: []byte{
	0x83,                   
	0x44, 0x67, 0x72, 0x69, 0x64, 
	0xF6, // nil protocol
	0xF6, // nil payload
},

However, when we unmarshal a CBOR null into a []byte, how does the decoder behave? According to the fxamacker/cbor documentation, when decoding a null into a []byte, it should set it to nil.

From the code in decode.go [4], the handling of nil is mentioned: "To unmarshal CBOR null (0xf6) and undefined (0xf7) values into a slice/map/pointer, Unmarshal sets Go value to nil."

So, if the CBOR has null (0xF6) for a []byte field, unmarshaling should set it to nil. Therefore, after the fix, the test case with nil fields should encode to nulls, and when decoded back, the fields should be nil.

Therefore, updating the test case's expected bytes to use 0xF6 instead of 0x40 for nil fields.

Once that's done, the test should pass because the unmarshaled Message will have nil Protocol and Payload.

So, the steps are:

1. In wire.go, remove the code that converts nil slices to empty slices in MarshalCBOR.
2. In wire_test.go, update the expected CBOR for the "nil fields" test case to use 0xF6 (null) for protocol and payload.
3. Ensure that the unmarshal correctly handles null as nil.

Additionally, check if the grid tag is correctly placed in wire.go. The user's initial request was to "move grid tag into wire.go". Looking at the current code, the gridTag is already defined in wire.go as a package-level variable. So that part is done.

Now, let's make the code changes.

In wire.go, the MarshalCBOR function is modified to remove the nil checks:

Original:
func (m Message) MarshalCBOR() ([]byte, error) {
	// Convert nil slices to empty slices to encode as empty byte strings
	proto := m.Protocol
	if proto == nil {
		proto = []byte{}
	}
	payload := m.Payload
	if payload == nil {
		payload = []byte{}
	}
	return em.Marshal([]interface{}{gridTag, proto, payload})
}

Modified:
func (m Message) MarshalCBOR() ([]byte, error) {
	return em.Marshal([]interface{}{gridTag, m.Protocol, m.Payload})
}

This change stops converting nil to empty slices.

In wire_test.go, the "nil fields" test case's expected CBOR is updated:

Original expected bytes:
[]byte{
	0x83,                   
	0x44, 0x67, 0x72, 0x69, 0x64, 
	0x40, // empty protocol bytes (0x40 is empty byte string)
	0x40, 
},

Updated expected bytes:
[]byte{
	0x83,                   
	0x44, 0x67, 0x72, 0x69, 0x64, 
	0xF6, // null for protocol
	0xF6, // null for payload
},

However, looking at the CBOR encoding of a nil slice, the code should now encode it as null. Let's check what the Marshal function does.

When marshaling a nil []byte, fxamacker/cbor should encode it as null. Let's confirm with an example.

If m.Protocol is nil, then in the slice []interface{}{gridTag, m.Protocol, m.Payload}, the second and third elements are nil []byte. The CBOR encoder should represent them as null (0xF6).

Therefore, the expected CBOR for the "nil fields" case should have 0xF6 for protocol and payload.

Updating the test case's expected bytes accordingly.

After making these changes, running the test should pass because:

- When marshaling a Message with nil Protocol and Payload, the CBOR will have nulls (0xF6).
- When unmarshaling, the decoder will set those fields to nil.

Thus, the test's checks for nil will pass.

Another thing to check is the handling during unmarshaling. In the current UnmarshalCBOR method, the code checks the type of parts[1] and parts[2]. For example:

switch v := parts[1].(type) {
case []byte:
	m.Protocol = v
case nil:
	m.Protocol = nil
default:
	return fmt.Errorf("protocol field has unexpected type: %T", parts[1])
}

Similarly for Payload.

This should correctly handle the case where the decoded value is nil (from CBOR null), setting m.Protocol to nil.

Therefore, with the changes, the test should pass.

Now, let's write the updated files.
