Okay, I need to brainstorm how PromiseGrid might handle multi-hop routing using a protocol where each message contains hashes of previous messages, allowing threads to merge. The routing method should forward messages to agents that have declared interest in ancestor messages. Let me start by understanding the existing routing.md content.

The existing document has 55 protocols, with the latest being CID-based routing. The user wants to add a new protocol that builds a message thread tree with merged threads. The example scenario involves Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave. 

First, the protocol needs agents to declare interest in specific message hashes (ancestors). When a new message references these ancestors, it's forwarded to interested agents. This sounds like a pub/sub system where subscriptions are based on message hashes. 

Looking at the existing protocols, number 54 and 55 use CID-based routing in a hypergraph. The new protocol should align with these but focus on message threads. Each message includes ancestor CIDs, and routing is based on who has those CIDs. 

In the example scenario, Alice starts with a root message (CID1). Bob, Carol, and Dave initially subscribe to the root. When Bob sends a message referencing CID1, it goes to those interested in CID1. Then Carol sends a message referencing CID2 (Bob's), which goes to those interested in CID2 or its ancestors. Dave's message references CID2, so it goes to those interested in CID2.

Wait, in the example steps, after Alice sends CID1, Bob, Carol, and Dave subscribe to CID1. When Bob sends CID2 referencing CID1, the message should go to agents interested in CID1. But Carol and Dave are subscribed to CID1, so they get it. Then Carol sends CID3 referencing CID2. Since Carol is now interested in CID2, the message should go to those interested in CID2 or its ancestors. But Dave might still be interested in CID1, which is an ancestor of CID2, so Dave would get it. Then Dave sends CID4 referencing CID2, which goes to those interested in CID2 or its ancestors (like Bob, if he's subscribed to CID2).

The existing protocol 56 in the file has a similar structure but uses ancestral CIDs. The new protocol should build on that, perhaps as protocol 57. The example needs to show how messages propagate based on declared interests. 

I need to structure the new protocol clearly, explain the message structure, routing rules, and provide the example scenario. Ensure that each message's ancestors determine the forwarding path. Also, highlight how agents update their subscriptions after receiving messages. 

The example should show Alice creating the root, Bob adding a child, Carol adding a grandchild, and Dave adding another child to Bob's message. The routing should demonstrate that each subsequent message is forwarded to agents interested in the ancestors. Make sure to include the JSON message structures and the subscription changes at each step.

# PromiseGrid Multi-Hop Routing Brainstorm

[... existing protocols 1-55 ...]

56. Hypergraph-Based CID Routing with Ancestral Interest Propagation  
    [existing protocol details...]

57. Threaded Message Routing via Ancestral Subscription  
    This protocol enables decentralized message threading through CID-based ancestor tracking and dynamic interest declarations[1].

    **Protocol Overview**  
    - Each message contains:  
      - `thread_id`: Unique identifier for message thread  
      - `parent_hashes`: One or more CID hashes of previous messages  
      - `content`: Message payload with cryptographic signature  

    **Routing Mechanism**  
    1. **Interest Declaration**: Agents proactively announce CIDs they possess using "IHave" promises  
    2. **Forwarding Logic**:  
       - On receiving message M with parent hashes P₁,P₂,...Pₙ  
       - Forward M to any agent that has declared interest in any Pᵢ  
       - Add M's CID to local interest registry if accepted  
    3. **Thread Merging**: Messages can reference multiple parent hashes, creating merged conversation threads  

    **Example Scenario**  
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[Alice: CID1] --> B[Bob: CID2]
        B --> C[Carol: CID3]
        B --> D[Dave: CID4]
    ```

    1. **Initial State**  
       - All agents declare interest in "root" CID (empty hash)  

    2. **Alice Sends Root Message**  
       ```json
       {
         "thread_id": "T1",
         "parent_hashes": [],
         "content": "Init thread",
         "signature": "AliceSig"
       }
       ```
       - CID1 generated, forwarded to all root subscribers  
       - Bob/Carol/Dave update interest registries to include CID1  

    3. **Bob Replies to CID1**  
       ```json
       {
         "thread_id": "T1",
         "parent_hashes": ["CID1"],
         "content": "Reply to Alice",
         "signature": "BobSig"
       }
       ```
       - CID2 generated  
       - Routed to CID1 subscribers (Alice/Carol/Dave)  

    4. **Carol Creates Merge Point**  
       ```json
       {
         "thread_id": "T1",
         "parent_hashes": ["CID2", "CID4"],
         "content": "Merge discussion",
         "signature": "CarolSig"
       }
       ```
       - CID5 generated  
       - Routed to CID2 (Bob) and CID4 (Dave) subscribers  
       - Creates merged thread visualization  

    **Failure Recovery**  
    - Stale branches automatically pruned via TTL-based CID unsubscription  
    - Conflict resolution through promise-based acknowledgement chains[4]
