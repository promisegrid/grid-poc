Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user wants fitness criteria derived from the provided README.md file, formatted as bullet points with weights between 1-100 in a .criteria.md file. 

First, I need to understand what fitness criteria mean in this context. From the search results, fitness functions are automated tests that measure architectural characteristics like scalability, performance, security, etc. They help ensure the system meets its non-functional requirements.

Looking at the README, the key features and concepts of PromiseGrid include decentralization, scalability, resilience, capability-based security, content-addressable storage, consensus models, and more. Each of these can be a criterion. 

I'll start by listing potential criteria based on the README sections:

1. Decentralized Architecture: The grid is user-owned and grows as nodes join. This is fundamental, so high weight.
2. Capability-Based Security: Emphasized in the architecture, crucial for access control. High weight.
3. Content-Addressable Code: Uses hashes for code/data addressing, important for scalability and resilience. High weight.
4. Merge-as-Consensus Model: Resolves conflicts, key for governance. Medium-high weight.
5. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Runs on various devices. Medium weight.
6. Computational Governance: Automated decision-making. Medium weight.
7. Decentralized Cache: Enhances performance and data replication. Medium weight.
8. Extensible Protocol (Universal Protocol): Allows future growth. Medium weight.
9. Community-Driven Development: Open-source contribution. Lower weight but still important.
10. Integration with Prior Technologies: Compatibility with existing tech like WASM. Lower weight.

Next, assign weights. The highest priorities are decentralization, security, and content addressing. Then consensus, compatibility, governance, cache, protocol extensibility, community, and prior tech integration.

Check if each criterion is directly mentioned in the README. For example, computational governance is a section, so that's a point. Merge-as-consensus is a key model described. Capability-based security is under technology concepts. 

Ensure each bullet follows the format: "- {weight} {description}". No markdown, just plain text. Wrap lines at 70 characters as per the user's request.

Finally, verify that all important aspects are covered and weights sum up to a reasonable total, though the user didn't specify a total sum. Make sure descriptions are concise and derived from the README content.
