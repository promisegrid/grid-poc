# Recommended Data Structures for Grid POC

## Problem Statement

The Grid POC aims to efficiently store and retrieve a vast number of large byte sequences and find small subsequences within them. The key requirements are:

- **Large Sequence Storage**:
  - Sizes range from a few bytes to hundreds of gigabytes.
  - Number of sequences ranges from a few to billions.
- **Subsequence Search**:
  - Subsequence sizes range from a few bytes to hundreds of megabytes.
  - Need to efficiently find small subsequences within large sequences.
- **Dynamic Updates and Versioning**:
  - Must handle frequent appends to large sequences.
  - Must handle slight modifications while preserving original sequences (forming a graph structure of versions).

## Recommended Data Structures

Based on the requirements, the following data structures and algorithms are recommended:

### 1. Content-Addressable Storage with Merkle DAGs

#### Description

- **Chunking**:
  - Break large sequences into smaller chunks (e.g., 4 KB to 4 MB).
  - Each chunk is uniquely identified by its cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256).
- **Merkle Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**:
  - Organize chunks in a DAG structure where nodes represent chunks and edges represent the relationship between chunks.
  - Each node's hash is derived from its content and references to child nodes.
  - The root hash represents the entire sequence.

#### Benefits

- **Efficient Storage of Large Sequences**:
  - Large sequences are represented by the root hash and the structure of the DAG.
  - Shared chunks between sequences are stored only once, reducing storage redundancy.
- **Deduplication**:
  - Identical chunks across sequences are automatically deduplicated due to identical hashes.
- **Efficient Versioning and Modifications**:
  - Modifications or appends result in new nodes, but unchanged parts of the DAG are reused.
  - Allows for efficient storage of versions, forming a graph structure of sequence versions.
- **Integrity Verification**:
  - The integrity of sequences can be verified by recalculating and comparing the root hash.

#### Handling Dynamic Updates

- **Frequent Appends**:
  - Appending data involves creating new chunks and updating the DAG structure accordingly.
- **Preserving Original Sequences**:
  - Since the DAG is immutable, modifications create new paths without altering existing nodes.
- **Graph of Versions**:
  - Versions of sequences form a DAG, providing a history of modifications and appends.

#### Considerations

- **Chunk Size Optimization**:
  - Choosing the right chunk size is crucial for balancing storage efficiency and performance.
  - Techniques like content-defined chunking (e.g., using Rabin fingerprints) can be employed to detect changes and optimize deduplication.
- **Metadata Overhead**:
  - Managing the DAG structure requires additional metadata for nodes and their relationships.

### 2. Suffix Trees and Suffix Arrays

#### Description

- **Suffix Trees**:
  - A compressed trie that contains all the suffixes of a sequence.
  - Enables fast substring searches and pattern matching.
- **Suffix Arrays**:
  - An array of all sorted suffixes of a sequence.
  - Uses less memory than suffix trees and can be combined with additional structures like the LCP (Longest Common Prefix) array.

#### Benefits

- **Efficient Subsequence Search**:
  - Allow for fast search of any substring within large sequences.
- **Handles Variable-Length Subsequences**:
  - Effective for searching subsequences ranging from a few bytes to hundreds of megabytes.
- **Finding Locations**:
  - Can return the starting positions of the subsequences within the large sequences.

#### Use Cases

- **Variable-Length Byte Sequence Search**:
  - Given a byte sequence, efficiently find all large byte sequences containing it and their locations.
- **DNA Fragment Search**:
  - Locate all occurrences of a DNA fragment within genomes, returning their positions.

#### Considerations

- **Memory Usage**:
  - Traditional suffix trees can be memory-intensive, especially for large datasets.
  - Suffix arrays are more memory-efficient but may require additional structures for optimal performance.
- **Construction Time**:
  - Building these structures for very large sequences can be time-consuming.

### 3. FM-Index and Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)

#### Description

- **Burrows-Wheeler Transform**:
  - A data transformation algorithm that rearranges a sequence to improve compressibility.
- **FM-Index**:
  - A compressed full-text substring index based on the BWT.
  - Allows efficient substring searching while keeping storage requirements low.

#### Benefits

- **Compressed Indexing**:
  - Uses significantly less space, suitable for very large sequences like genomes.
- **Fast Search Capabilities**:
  - Searches are performed in time proportional to the length of the query, not the dataset.
- **Handles Any Byte Values**:
  - Suitable for sequences containing arbitrary byte values.

#### Use Cases

- **DNA Fragment Search in Genomes**:
  - Efficiently find all occurrences and positions of a DNA fragment within large genome sequences.
- **Variable-Length Byte Sequence Search**:
  - Search for any byte sequence within large datasets without excessive memory overhead.

#### Considerations

- **Update Limitations**:
  - Not ideal for datasets requiring frequent modifications, as updates to the index are complex.
- **Complex Implementation**:
  - More complex to implement compared to other indexing methods.

### 4. k-mer Indexing

#### Description

- **k-mers**:
  - Substrings of length k extracted from sequences.
- **Indexing**:
  - Create an index mapping k-mers to their positions within sequences.

#### Benefits

- **Efficient Fixed-Length Subsequence Search**:
  - Ideal for searching fixed-length patterns across large datasets.
- **Parallelizable**:
  - Indexing and searching can be parallelized for performance gains.

#### Use Cases

- **DNA Fragment Search**:
  - Commonly used in genomics to find all occurrences of specific DNA fragments.
- **Fixed-Length Byte Sequence Search**:
  - Find and locate fixed-size byte patterns within large sequences.

#### Considerations

- **Memory Consumption**:
  - Index size can become large with small k values due to the vast number of possible k-mers.
- **Variable-Length Sequences**:
  - Less effective for variable-length subsequences unless multiple indexes are used.

### 5. Inverted Indexes

#### Description

- **Indexing Approach**:
  - Map from subsequences (or tokens) to the locations in the data where they appear.
- **Adaptation for Byte Sequences**:
  - Can index sequences of bytes or patterns to support arbitrary byte sequences.

#### Benefits

- **Efficient Search**:
  - Quickly retrieve all sequences containing a given subsequence.
- **Handles Arbitrary Sequences**:
  - Capable of indexing any arbitrary sequence of bytes.
- **Dynamic Updates**:
  - Supports additions and deletions to the index as sequences are modified.

#### Use Cases

- **Variable-Length Byte Sequence Search**:
  - Find large sequences containing any given subsequence, returning their locations.
- **DNA Fragment Search across Genomes**:
  - Retrieve all genomes containing a specific DNA fragment and its positions.

#### Considerations

- **Index Size**:
  - Can become very large, requiring strategies for index compression or distribution.
- **Search Complexity**:
  - Performance depends on the frequency of the subsequence in the data.

### 6. Combination of Methods

#### Description

- **Hybrid Approaches**:
  - Combine content-addressable storage with advanced indexing structures like suffix trees, FM-indexes, or inverted indexes.
- **Layered Indexing**:
  - Use high-level indexes to filter candidate sequences before detailed search.

#### Benefits

- **Optimized Performance**:
  - Balances storage efficiency with fast search capabilities.
- **Scalability**:
  - Effective for handling large-scale data with efficient update mechanisms.
- **Flexibility**:
  - Supports various use cases by selecting appropriate combinations.

#### Considerations

- **Complexity**:
  - Integration of multiple data structures adds to system complexity.
- **Resource Management**:
  - Requires careful management of computational and memory resources.

## Handling Dynamic Updates and Versioning

### Graph Structure for Versions

- **Merkle DAGs for Versioning**:
  - Model sequences and their versions as nodes in a Merkle DAG.
  - Edges represent references to child nodes (chunks) or previous versions.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Data Lineage**:
    - Trace the history of changes.
  - **Efficient Storage**:
    - Shared data between versions is stored only once.
  - **Immutable Data Structures**:
    - Facilitate concurrent access and prevent conflicts.

### Efficient Appends

- **Chunk-Based Updates**:
  - Append new data as new chunks and update DAG references.
- **Preserving Original Sequences**:
  - Original sequences remain intact in the DAG; new versions share common chunks.
- **Version Graph**:
  - Versions form a graph structure, capturing the evolution of sequences over time.
