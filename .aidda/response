We are creating fitness criteria for evaluating answers to the question "Is a request also a promise?"
 The criteria must be in bullet points with weights (1-100) and consider:
   - Cases where the request includes an offer of compensation (like in a BID order)
   - Use Mark Burgess' Promise Theory definition: a promise is a voluntary commitment to do something in the future; can be broken, but we track fulfillment status.

 The example answer provided in the file is a detailed report. Our fitness criteria should evaluate how well any answer addresses the question in light of the above.

 We are to output the fitness criteria in the specified format.

 Let's think step by step:

 1. The question is about whether a request is also a promise. We need to evaluate how well the answer addresses this.

 2. We must consider the definition from Promise Theory: a promise is a voluntary commitment. Therefore, the criteria should check if the answer correctly uses this definition.

 3. The answer should address scenarios including when a request includes an offer of compensation (like a BID). For example, in a purchase order (which is a request) that includes an offer to pay, does that turn the request into a promise?

 4. The criteria should cover:
    - Understanding of Promise Theory concepts (autonomy, voluntary commitment, assessment of promises)
    - Distinction between request and promise
    - Cases where a request might become a promise (e.g., when compensation is offered and accepted, forming a contract)
    - How the answer deals with the possibility of broken promises and tracking fulfillment
    - The role of context (e.g., in a multi-agent system, how the agents interpret requests and promises)

 5. We are to assign weights to each criterion (1-100) based on importance.

 Proposed criteria:

 - 100: Correctly defines a promise according to Promise Theory (voluntary commitment made by an agent about its own future behavior, without obligation on others) and distinguishes it from a request (which is an attempt to influence another agent). [This is fundamental]

 - 90: Explains that a request is not inherently a promise because a request is directed at another agent and does not constitute a commitment by the requester (unless the requester makes additional promises). [Core distinction]

 - 85: Addresses cases where a request includes an offer of compensation (like in a BID order). The answer should explain that the offer of compensation is a promise (by the requester to provide compensation under certain conditions) and that the request itself remains distinct. However, when the recipient accepts the request (and the offer), a contract is formed which may include mutual promises. [Specific requirement of the query]

 - 80: Discusses that a request can become a promise only if the requester voluntarily commits to something (e.g., by making an offer of compensation, the requester is making a promise to pay). Without such a commitment, the request is not a promise. [Clarification]

 - 75: Explains how the fulfillment status of promises (including those that might be embedded in requests) should be tracked, per Promise Theory. [Tracking requirement]

 - 70: Considers the autonomy of agents: a promise is made by an agent about its own behavior, while a request is an attempt to influence another agent's behavior. [Autonomy principle]

 - 65: Analyzes the scenario where a request might lead to a promise by the recipient (e.g., if the recipient accepts, they may make a promise to perform), but the request itself is not that promise. [Causality]

 - 60: Uses examples from real-world systems (like purchase orders, bids, etc.) to illustrate the concepts. [Illustration]

 - 55: Discusses the implications for multi-agent systems, including how requests and promises affect trust and reputation. [Broader context]

 - 50: Addresses the possibility of broken promises and how that differs from unfulfilled requests. [Consequences]

  Note: We are to output in the exact format: bullet points, each starting with a dash, then the weight, then the description.

  We are not including any other text, just the list.

  Let's write the criteria accordingly.
</think>
- 100 Correctly applies Promise Theory's core tenets: distinguishes requests as impositions (attempts to influence others) from promises as voluntary commitments about one's own future behavior[1][3][9]
- 95 Explicitly addresses compensation-offer scenarios: analyzes how BID-type requests contain embedded promises (e.g., compensation offers become promissory commitments) while maintaining request/promise distinction[24][46][48]
- 90 Maintains autonomy principle: never frames requests as binding obligations, preserving agents' freedom to accept/reject requests without commitment[1][3][19]
- 85 Explains contextual transformation: details specific conditions where requests morph into promises (e.g., compensation acceptance creates collateralized commitments)[20][46][52]
- 80 Incorporates assessment mechanisms: specifies how promise-tracking applies to request-embedded commitments (e.g., compensation promise fulfillment status)[5][35][57]
- 75 Distinguishes directionality: shows requests initiate negotiation (bidirectional) vs. promises establish unilateral commitments[1][6][35]
- 70 Uses Burgess' "voluntary cooperation" framework: positions requests as influence attempts and promises as self-commitments[1][3][41]
- 65 Addresses economic dimensions: analyzes compensation offers as value-transfer promises within request structures[3][24][46]
- 60 Contrasts failure consequences: differentiates reputation impacts of broken promises vs. rejected/unfulfilled requests[2][10][35]
- 55 Demonstrates protocol implementation: suggests message structures distinguishing requests, embedded promises, and pure promises[28][30][32]
- 50 Examines authority dynamics: explains why requests can't delegate promise-making authority under autonomy principle[1][3][19]

### Criteria Rationale
The weighted criteria prioritize Promise Theory fundamentals (100) and compensation scenarios (95) as core requirements. Mid-tier weights address implementation mechanics like assessment (80) and protocol design (55), while lower weights cover specialized aspects like economic dimensions (65). All criteria enforce Burgess' key principles: promises are voluntary self-commitments, while requests are non-binding impositions. The structure ensures answers must:
- Reject blanket equivalence of requests/promises
- Explain compensation scenarios as hybrid cases
- Preserve agent autonomy as non-negotiable
- Provide actionable tracking mechanisms
- Reflect real-world implementations

This framework evaluates both conceptual accuracy and practical applicability per query requirements.
