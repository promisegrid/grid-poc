cbor2dot: make the edges from the tree nodes point at the commit message node, not the new commit hash node

The goal is to be able to use 'git2cbor' to convert a git object to a CBOR
representation, and then use 'cbor2git' to convert the CBOR representation
back to a git object in another repository such that the commit hash is the
same.  There should also be a few utility subcommands to help visualize the
CBOR representation.
