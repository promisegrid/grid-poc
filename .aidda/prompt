recommend a better design than the Get* methods but that still
satisfies the requirements for CBOR encoding and decoding; we don't
want method names and field names to be the same

ensure Store is thread-safe


recommend a data structure 

problem:

- for the application described in README.md
- that can store a large number of large byte sequences 
- that can find a small subsequence of bytes among all large byte
  sequences
- small sequence size ranges from a few bytes to hundreds of megabytes
- large sequence size ranges from a few bytes to hundreds of gigabytes 
- number of large sequences ranges from a few to billions
- must be able to handle variable-length byte sequences
- must be able to handle sequences containing any byte value
- must be able to handle sequences containing any arbitrary sequence of
  bytes
- must be able to handle frequent appends to large sequences
- must be able to handle slight modifications to large sequences while
  preserving the original large sequence (e.g. maybe the set of all
  versions of a large sequence is a graph structure)
  
changes:

- expand merkle DAG description and usage
- refine conclusions
- make no other changes
