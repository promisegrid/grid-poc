Given a git ref on the command line, emit the corresponding CBOR-encoded
object to stdout.  If no ref is given, emit the CBOR-encoded object for
HEAD.

machine such that the commit hash is the same. Add date and time to
the output, as well as any other attributes that are necessary to
ensure that the commit hash is the same.
