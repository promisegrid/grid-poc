The goal is to be able to use 'git2cbor' to convert a git object to a CBOR
representation, and then use 'cbor2git' to convert the CBOR representation
back to a git object in another repository such that the commit hash is the
same.

- add a cbor2json subcommand that converts a CBOR representation to an
  indented, pretty-printed JSON representation
- add a cbor2dot subcommand that converts a CBOR representation to a
  graphviz dot file.  the dot file show the structure of the CBOR
  representation in a directed graph, with the parent objects as
  tails, the child objects as heads, and the commit message as a large
  oval-shaped node in the center
