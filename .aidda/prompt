recommend a data structure 

problem:

- for the application described in README.md
- that can store a large number of large byte sequences 
- that can find a small subsequence of bytes among all large byte
  sequences
- small sequence size ranges from a few bytes to hundreds of megabytes
- large sequence size ranges from a few bytes to hundreds of gigabytes 
- number of large sequences ranges from a few to billions
- must be able to handle frequent appends to large sequences
- must be able to handle slight modifications to large sequences while
  preserving the original large sequence (e.g. maybe the set of all
  versions of a large sequence is a graph structure)
  
possible solutions:

- include solutions already in description.md
- include a monte carlo approach
- include probabilistic data structures
