Sysmsg: You are an expert Go programmer. Please make the requested changes
 to the given code or documentation.

Implement subcommands for `git-cbor`.  

Move the existing code into a subcommand called `git2cbor`.  

Add a new subcommand called `cbor2git` that does the reverse.  

Add a new subcommand called `cbor2diag` that takes a CBOR-encoded object
and emits a human-readable CBOR diagnostic representation of the object.

The goal is to be able to use 'git2cbor' to convert a git object to a CBOR
representation, and then use 'cbor2git' to convert the CBOR representation
back to a git object in another repository such that the commit hash is the
same.
