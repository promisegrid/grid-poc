The goal is to be able to use 'git2cbor' to convert a git object to a CBOR
representation, and then use 'cbor2git' to convert the CBOR representation
back to a git object in another repository such that the commit hash is the
same.  There should also be a few utility subcommands to help visualize the
CBOR representation.

in cbor2dot:
- use only the first 8 characters of the commit hash as the node name
- use only the first line of the commit message as the node label
- the edges from "blob content" nodes should point at their respective
  "blob" nodes, not at the "commit" node
- the new commit hash node should be at the head of an edge from the
  commit message node
- the parents and tree nodes should be at the tail of edges to the 
  commit message node
