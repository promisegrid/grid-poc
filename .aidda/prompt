publish an IPNS record 

In a subroutine, publish an IPNS record for the root CID of the
three-node DAG.  The record should be signed with the private key
named "three-node-dag-test".  If the private key does not exist,
create it.

Refer to /home/stevegt/lab/ipfs/kubo/client/rpc/name.go for how to
publish an IPNS record.

check doc against requirements

Ensure that the document meets these requirements:

- Understand that these promises are Burgess-style promises according
  to Promise Theory:  An agent can only make promises about its own
  behavior, not the behavior of other agents. 
- Promises are not requests for action.
- A promise is an agent's assertion that the promised DAG edit
  operation is valid.
- Preserve the ability to replay messages to recreate the DAG.
- Ensure that the DAG is a valid representation of the worldline(s) at
  any point in time.  
- Understand whether each worldline has its own DAG, or if there is a
  single DAG that represents all known worldlines.
- Understand how the DAG works when not all referenced leaves or inner
  nodes are accessible.
- Understand whether a CWT is a promise itself, or if it is a
  container for one or more promises expressed as claims.
- explore the possibility that the structure we're looking for is
  something new, not a conventional merkle DAG.

discuss worldlines

Edit worldlines.md to describe the worldline completion model for a
messaging system.  Discuss what a worldline data structure might look
like and how it might be implemented.  Discuss how the worldline
completion model look in one or more examples.  Provide examples using
"Alice", "Bob", etc. as agents in the system.  Show one or more
examples of a DAG edit message, including insert, delete, and reorder
operations.  Show one or more examples of a DAG query message.  Show
one or more examples of a DAG subscription message.  Discuss how the
DAG edit message, DAG query message, and DAG subscription message
might be expressed as CWT claims.  Finally, review the entire document
for consistency, calling out any inconsistencies that exist.

Ensure that the following points are addressed:

- there are multiple worldlines -- they can branch and merge
- a message is a DAG edit operation that inserts, deletes, or reorders
  events and is a promise that the resulting worldline(s) are valid
- events are organized in a merkle DAG instead of using sequence numbers
- events (DAG leaves) themselves do not contain the hash of the previous event
- DAG internal nodes contain the hashes of their children in worldline order
- editing the DAG allows for inserting, deleting, and reordering events
- the DAG editing language is the same as the DAG query or subscription language
- the DAG edit/query language is expressible as CWT claims (promises)
- timestamps are from the perspective of the agent that created the event
- events are signed by the agent that created the event
- EventType is not a field in the event
- Payload is a set of one or more PT-style promises
- a message is a promise that the event exists at that point on the worldline
- discuss the use of "message" and "event" as synonyms, and recommend a
  consistent usage
- a single message might edit multiple worldlines
- replay ability is a key feature of the system
- a message (edit operation) includes the hashes of the old 
  merkle DAG nodes for the event(s) being edited
- a single event might appear in multiple worldlines
- a DAG node is a log of the messages that edited it 
- ensure that low-level claims are in fact promises rather than
  requests

A thought:  An individual DAG node is like a git repo, with its own
history of edits, branches, and merges, all tied together via hashes.
An entire DAG can be re-created as of any point in time by replaying
the messages that created it, and those mesages are stored in the individual
DAG nodes.

A clarification:  When we say "promise", we mean Promise Theory-style
promises as described by Mark Burgess, not a request for action.
Please review all uses of the term "promise", including in the
message examples, to ensure that we are using the term correctly.

A correction:  The message examples given are not properly-structured
CWT or JWT messages.  Please review the relevant RFCs and ensure that
the example messages are properly-structured.

A correction:  A message contains one or more promises expressed as
JWT or CWT claims.  Each claim is an edit operation on the merkle DAG
that represents a worldline.  Please ensure that the examples given
show the correct structure for a message.

first draft of a WASM component model version of the hello demo

Not yet functional; pausing work on WASM, likely until after both
grid-poc and grid-cli are working.

Write a README.md file that lists the files needed for a version of
the hello demo that makes use of the WASM component model. The README.md
should include all files needed to build and run the demo. The file
list should consist of the name of each file and a one-line description.

Include the pieces of workflow and intermediate files that normally
make up a WASM component model project, including WIT and other
component-specific files.

recommend a better design than the Get* methods but that still
satisfies the requirements for CBOR encoding and decoding; we don't
want method names and field names to be the same

ensure Store is thread-safe


recommend a data structure 

problem:

- for the application described in README.md
- that can store a large number of large byte sequences 
- that can find a small subsequence of bytes among all large byte
  sequences
- small sequence size ranges from a few bytes to hundreds of megabytes
- large sequence size ranges from a few bytes to hundreds of gigabytes 
- number of large sequences ranges from a few to billions
- must be able to handle variable-length byte sequences
- must be able to handle sequences containing any byte value
- must be able to handle sequences containing any arbitrary sequence of
  bytes
- must be able to handle frequent appends to large sequences
- must be able to handle slight modifications to large sequences while
  preserving the original large sequence (e.g. maybe the set of all
  versions of a large sequence is a graph structure)
  
changes:

- expand merkle DAG description and usage
- refine conclusions
- make no other changes
