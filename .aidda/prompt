recommend a data structure 

problem:

- for the application described in README.md
- that can store a large number of large byte sequences 
- that can find a small subsequence of bytes among all large byte sequences
- small sequence size ranges from a few bytes to hundreds of megabytes
- large sequence size ranges from a few bytes to hundreds of gigabytes 
- number of large sequences ranges from a few to billions

possible solutions:

- possibly use the sort of data structure used in DNA sequence database implementations
- discuss the various data structures that could be used
